# Notes on recording the presentation

1. Use I can use Zoom to record the session on my local machine
2. I need to have the three demos setup and running in a terminal session (via tux) that will not be featured in the presentation
3. README's for each demo need to be better
4. Use GitHub to walk through the generated demos' codebase that way I don't loose time switching out of browser sharing and back into it
5. I'm not sure I need to show my image while presenting, if I'm sitting I tended to rock in my chair allot
6. avoid putting my hand infront of my mouse or touching my nose
7. enounciete better, e.g. postgREST (pronounce the "t" clearly)
8. Talk is still over one hour, need to shoot for 40 minutes so their is time for questions
9. demo demo time it about right but pre-demo time is too long

# Content fixes

1. improve the READM.md files to be meaning ful
2. build.sh needs to show a multiline Pandoc statement
3. decide if I am going to use `${...}` or `$...$` syntax in Newt and use the same in the templates
4. Figure out how to remove "my_secret_password" from example setup.sql, I could use a SQL statement to generated a random password that is written out or I might be able to bring those in from the environment somehow
