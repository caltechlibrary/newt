<h1
id="type-dsl-a-domain-specific-language-describing-a-variables-type">Type
DSL, a domain specific language describing a variables’ type</h1>
<p>Type DSL evolved from thinking about mapping of one URL path to
another. Many web frameworks implement the concept of a “route” which is
similar to a file path but may include a placeholder notation for values
bound to variable names. The variable names are then available to route
handler functions. If you are extracting values and binding them to
varaible names it is extremely helpful to have type information.</p>
<p>Newt needed to support embedded typed variables in it mapping
ability. It also was needed by Newt to support generating SQL bootstrap
code from a simplified Model description. Newt uses the type information
to vet inputs bound to a varaible name as well as when generating
bootstrep SQL for a Newt+Postgres+PostgREST+Pandoc (N3P)
application.</p>
<p>I surveyed the route descriptions available in several Python and
JavaScript frameworks. There was no consensus about how to declare
variables and nothing that would allow vetting the variables by type.
Newt implemented a Type DSL to provide a way to remedy this
situation.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-urls-a-use-case">Blogging URLs, a use case</h2>
<p>TypeDSL should be able to handle simple mappings such as those seen
in blogs. Blog paths are often predictable. A home page is at
<code>/</code>, a feed of items might be at <code>/feed/</code> and
individual blog posts might be found in a path formed by embedding four
digit year, two digit month, two digit day and a title slug. Let’s first
look at how that would be described as a Mustache template –
<code>/blog/${year}/${month}/${day}/${title-slug}</code>. This is pretty
easy to read.</p>
<p>How do we know when a path value matches a route? For a literal path
you can simply perform a string comparison but for a path with embedded
variables you need to vet the variables to make sure they make sense. A
type check needs to be done. In our simple Mustache version though there
is no type information. The place holder <code>${year}</code> might hold
an integer or maybe something completely unrelated. What if we added an
annotation about the variables type? A “year” certainly can be validate.
Years are normally four digit numbers. Likewise month and day could have
a simple validation based on being an integer with two digits allowing
for leading zeros. These are common enough date formats that many
languages provide via standard libraries. Creating types for these types
becomes a matter of wrapping our implementation of referencing the
variables with a type system. Here’s how we might express that in
YAML.</p>
<pre><code>var:
  year: Year
  month: Month
  day: Day
  title-slug: String</code></pre>
<p>Now we can validate our path against the types assigned.</p>
<pre><code>/blog/${year}/${month}/${day}/${title-slug}</code></pre>
<p>Now we know the type and validation method to apply to the embedded
variable. Let’s explore some values and see if they can be
validated.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">path value</th>
<th>year</th>
<th>month</th>
<th>day</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">title-slug</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">is it valid?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post</td>
<td>2023</td>
<td>02</td>
<td>28</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">my-daily-post</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">yes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">/blog/2023/02/31/my-daily-post</td>
<td>2023</td>
<td>02</td>
<td>31</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">my-daily-post</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">no, invalid day</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">/blog/2023/28/02/my-daily-post</td>
<td>2023</td>
<td>28</td>
<td>01</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">my-daily-post</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">no, invalid month</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Knowing the type lets the router know that path is not valid and
reject it if it is not without contacting other services.</p>
<p>While the TypeDSL specification is not intended to describe a
canonical set of types an implementation of a TypeDSL certain would. It
should be easy to implement the type system with one or two functions
per type. I suspect as TypeDSL are implemented a canonical core set of
type will emerge.</p>
<p>In my prototype implementation of TypeDSL I plan to implement the
following types and validating primitive data types – “Integer”,
“String”, “Real”, “Boolean”, “Date”, “Year”, “Month”, “Day”, “Hour”,
“Minute”, “Second”. The Python project <a
href="https://idutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">IdUtils</a> also
suggests a common set of identifiers used in the Library, Archive and
Museum communities. A subset of these will be implemented for the
prototype of TypeDSL (e.g. “ORCID”, “DOI”, “ROR”).</p>
<p>Using the previously defined types our URL provides the validated
values we need to transform to a API URL.</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:3000/blog?year=${year}&amp;month=${month}&amp;day=${day}&amp;title_slug=${title-slug}</code></pre>
<p>If the request value matches both form and type of embedded variables
then you have enough information to call a microservice like PostgREST,
Solr or Opensearch.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-representing-filenames-and-extensions-in-a-path">Use
case, representing filenames and extensions in a path</h2>
<p>What if your request URL uses file extensions to indicate the choice
of template to use when rendering with Pandoc? Here’s three examples
where the content might be the same but the format changes (e.g. HTML,
Markdown and plain text).</p>
<pre><code>/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post.html
/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post.md
/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post.txt</code></pre>
<p>In our prior example each embedded variable was contained in one
element of the path. A filename can be thought of as one element or as a
“basename” and “extension”. How can we allow for that use case? In the
use case about the “title-slug” corresponds to the “basename” but the
file extension indicates which template to send to Pandoc server.</p>
<p>Here’s how you might represent that in TypeDSL.</p>
<pre><code>var:
  year: Year
  month: Month
  day: Day
  title-slug: Basename
  ext: Extname</code></pre>
<p>We can then use our request path expression.</p>
<pre><code>`/blog/${year}/${month}/${day}/${title-slug}${ext}`</code></pre>
<p>Many implementation languages support parsing path into directory
components as well as filename and extension. TypeDSL should be able to
leverage this. This suggests an algorithmic behavior in our TypeDSL
evaluation.</p>
<p>First TypeDSL should split the path into it’s component, then it
should determine if the component is a literal string or a variable
definition. For each component the variable definition needs to conform
to it’s type. The trailing element in a URL path can also have the types
of “basename” (excluding the file extension), extname (for the file
extension value). In the case where you want to treat both the basename
and extension as a single unit we have the String type shown
previously.</p>
<h2
id="algorithm-for-evaluating-a-path-value-against-a-typedsl-expression">Algorithm
for evaluating a path value against a TypeDSL expression</h2>
<ul>
<li>A TypeDSL expression decode into it’s path components parts
<ul>
<li>zero or more directory names

<li>directory name can be a literal</li>

<li>zero or one filename

<li>a filename can be a literal</li>
<li>a filename can be a variable expression</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A path value is split into it’s components
<ul>
<li>zero or more directory names</li>
<li>zero or one filename and extension</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare each path value element against each TypeDSL expression
elements
<ul>

</ul></li>

against variable type
<ul>
<li>stop of it does not validate, return false</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If comparison completes without return false we have a match</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variable-definitions">Variable definitions</h2>
<p>In the use cases we’ve suggested how a variable in a TypeDSL
expression can include a variable name as well as a type annotation to
use to validate the value bound to the variable name. Let’s specify this
in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>variable definition start with two opening curly brace and conclude
with a closing curly brace (i.e. basic Mustache template style
notation)</li>
<li>following the opening curly braces is a variable name which is
formed from a letter and one or more alphanumeric characters or an
underscores or dashes (i.e. what would be a valid attribute name in a
JSON object). E.g. - <code>a</code>, <code>a1</code>,
<code>a_long_variable_name</code>, <code>title-slug</code> are valid
variable names
<ul>
<li><code>""</code>, <code>1a</code>, <code>+1</code>, <code>{}</code>,
<code>()</code>, <code>$foo</code> are not valid variable names</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a variable name is followed by a space and type expression</li>
<li>a type expression starts with a letter and can be followed by one or
more characters excluding a closing curly brace</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s some example variable definitions.</p>
<pre><code>var:
  year: Year
  month: Month
  day: Day
  orcid: ORCID</code></pre>
<p>These would result in the following type maps expressed in JSON</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;year&quot;: &quot;Year&quot;,
    &quot;month&quot;: &quot;Month&quot;,
    &quot;day&quot;: &quot;Day&quot;,
    &quot;orcid&quot;: &quot;ORCID&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>When a request URL is evaluated against the route template’s type it
will return a simple object with variable names mapped to string
versions of the values. This will allow transforming both data API URLs
and calls to Pandoc service via a simple Mustache like template
implementation.</p>
<p>The TypeDSL does not define the supported types only that the
information can be extracted from a TypeDSL expression as a map between
variable names and a type description. It is up to the specific TypeDSL
implementation to define how the type information is interpreted.</p>
<h2 id="variable-decoding">Variable decoding</h2>
<p>If a path value matches a TypeDSL expression then when the variables
and values can be extracted as a map of variable names and values. The
only constraint is that the map be expressible as a valid JSON object.
E.g.</p>
<p>Given the TypeDSL expression</p>
<pre><code>var:
  orcid: ORCID</code></pre>
<p>Request path we’re describing</p>
<pre><code>/people/${orcid}</code></pre>
<p>and the path value</p>
<pre><code>/people/0000-0003-0900-6903</code></pre>
<p>The resulting map would look like this JSON</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;orcid&quot;: &quot;0000-0003-0900-6903&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>Given the TypeDSL expression</p>
<pre><code>var:
  year: Year
  month: Month
  day: Day
  title-slug: Basename
  ext: Extname</code></pre>
<p>Request path expression</p>
<pre><code>/blog/${year}/${month}/${day}/${title-slug}${ext}</code></pre>
<p>And the path value</p>
<pre><code>/blog/2022/11/07/compiling-pandoc-from-source.html</code></pre>
<p>A TypeDSL implementation should return a map, dictionary or
associative array with the values converted to the type suggested in the
variable’s type definition. The constraint is that the map can be
expressed as a JSON object. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;year&quot;: 2022,
    &quot;month&quot;: 11,
    &quot;day&quot;: 7,
    &quot;title-slug&quot;: &quot;compiling-pandoc-from-source&quot;,
    &quot;ext&quot;: &quot;.html&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case our types “Month”, “Day”, “Year” converted the values to
JSON numbers and the rest were left as JSON strings.</p>
<h2 id="sql-generation-a-use-case">SQL generation, a use case</h2>
<p>When exploring working building application directory on Postgres via
PostgREST one of the reactions I encountered was a resistence to SQL.
This I think is unfortunate as modern SQL, exspecially in Postgres, is a
rich capable langauge for managing and manipulating data. One thing I’ve
noticed over the years is that colleagues will often feel more
confortable modifying SQL then writing it from scratch. The Type DSL was
initially developed for vetting routes but it occurred to me that is can
also be used to describe a data model. This lead to the “models”
attribute in a Newt YAML file. RDMS support table datastructures. These
are easily calculated from a simple key/value notation. It then is
possible to bootstrap simple data models in Postgres by evaluating a map
of variable names and their type descriptions. Once you know the table
structure you can also calculate some basic views and functions for
working with the table (e.g. most applications need to support CRUD,
create, read, update and delete).</p>
