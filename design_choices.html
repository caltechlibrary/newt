<h2 id="system-design-choices">System design choices</h2>
<p>Demonstrating the “Newt stack” has resulted in questions. Here’s the
big four questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why SQL? Why build your data models with SQL?</li>
<li>Pandoc as rendering engine, why?</li>
<li>Why YAML for configuration?</li>
<li>How do I handle file uploads?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answer to the first question: I think knowing at least some SQL is
unavoidable as a web developer. While many have adopted an ORM<a
href="ORM,%20object%20relational%20mapper.%20An%20ORM%20maps%20programs%20objects%20to%20a%20SQL%20syntax.%20With%20the%20advent%20of%20JSON%20columns%20in%20SQL%20tables%20this%20is%20rearly%20a%20problem%20anymore.%20Just%20focus%20on%20SQL.">1</a>
to generate the SQL to render models and manage data the resulting SQL
is often far from ideal. This is inspite of the fact that the ORM
concept is decades old. The problem I worry about with ORM (yes, I’ve
use them) isn’t inefficiency. The real problem is the ORM obscures the
data model and that discourages data re-use. The vast majority of web
applications run in institutional settings use SQL databases
(e.g. MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQLite3). Embracing SQL gives you power
to extend those systems and even integrte them. In 2024 SQL remains the
common language to manage data in a database. That’s true even have a
half century of existence. Even for non-relational data this has become
true<a
href="I&#39;ve%20heard%20of%20people%20querying%20S3%20buckets%20using%20a%20SQL%20SELECT%20statement%20and%20used%20utilities%20in%20the%20shell%20to%20do%20the%20same%20with%20text%20files.">2</a>.
SQL may look ugly or quirky but it definately has legs and plans to
stick around for a very long time. Let’s embrace it!</p>
<p>You may protest, “but some people really hate writing SQL!” Newt does
provide a tool to address this. Newt provides <code>newtpg</code> that
can take a data model described in the Newt configuration file and
render SQL suitable for standanding up and managing data in Postgres and
PostgREST. Another tool, <code>newtform</code> planed for development,
will render the same model to HTML 5 and JavaScript so you can keep your
model paired between the JSON API that manages the data and your
brower’s web form for doing data entry. in YAML that can be used to
generate Postgres SQL as well as simple HTML 5 web forms. Of course Newt
just provides a tool, you don’t have to use it and you’re welcome to
write SQL and your web forms from scratch.</p>
<p>The second question, why run Pandoc server to render things? Pandoc
is good at transforming structured text. JSON is structured text and
Pandoc can easily turn that into HTML. It is also ready to go in the
spirit of using “off the shelf” micro services. In the data science and
library circles I travel I’ve seen a huge adoption of Pandoc for static
site generation. That lead me to pick PAndoc as a rendering engine for
my Newt<a
href="Using%20Pandoc%20for%20the%20render%20engine%20could%20change%20in%20the%20future%20as%20long%20as%20a%20common%20way%20to%20package%20the%20results%20from%20template,%20options%20and%20data%20source%20response%20is%20as%20simple%20as%20it%20is%20with%20Pandoc%20server.">4</a>
prototype. If another template language and engine comes on the scene,
Newt can be adapted to us it instead<a
href="The%20group%20behind%20PostgREST%20is%20also%20developing%20an%20Postgres%20embedable%20Mustache%20engine,%20that%20may%20make%20sense%20too.">5</a>.
If you really don’t like Pandoc templates Newt now provides a similar
engine that supports Mustache templates, <code>newtmustache</code>.</p>
<p>The third question, “Why YAML for configuration?”. Personally I’m
enthusiastic about YAML. It is sort of boring. But I think that is is
strength. YAML has become umbiquious for describing configuration and
simple data structures. It easily converts to JSON. It’s declarative.
Newt uses YAML largely because it’s well known and is specifically known
by my colleagues at Caltech Library. Why invent a new language when I
can use one that is already known?</p>
<p>Final question is “How do I handle file uploads?”. The short answer
is Newt doesn’t. Eventually I plan to support for S3 protocol storage
systems (e.g. Minio, S3) but I haven’t had time to implement this and do
not need it for the application I am building with Newt. A longer answer
is yes, it is possible but you need to know Postgres really well.
Technically Postgres+PostgreSQL can handle file uploads because you can
store files or large objects in Postgres. Personally I don’t want to
store files in my data base management system. I’d rather store them in
an object store like S3. I don’t recomment Newt for applications that
require handling file uploads unless you want to write your own micro
service to implement it.</p>
<p>Newt’s configuration langauge is YAML. YAML was picked because it is
widely use in 2023/2024. I don’t need to explain it to my colleagues or
peers they already use it. Newt implements a “domain specific language”
or DSL on top of YAML to support rendering SQL data models targetting
Postgres. YAML is also an easy language to use to describe the
information needed for data routing in Newt. YAML seemed a good fit for
Newt.</p>
<h3 id="newts-minimal-feature-set">Newt’s minimal feature set</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>newt</code> as a two stage data router</li>
<li><code>newt</code> as static file service</li>
<li><code>newtpg</code> can use the Newt configuration file to render
simple data models as SQL generator suitable to bootstrap a
PostgREST+Postgres JSON API</li>
<li><code>newtform</code> can use the Newt configuration file to render
simple HTML/Markdown forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the data flow steps of <code>newt</code> data router.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Web browser =&gt; (Web Server proxy) =&gt; Newt</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; data source (e.g. Postgres + PostgREST or S3 Object
store)</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; Pandoc (optional step)</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; (Web Server proxy) =&gt; Web browser</li>
</ol>
<p>The person developing with Newt writes SQL to define the back end,
may write Pandoc templates if that is desired and builds the front end
with standard static web assets (e.g. HTML pages, CSS, JavaScript). Newt
can support traditional websites and single page applications. It just
saves writing a whole bunch of services that already exist.</p>
<h2 id="orchestrating-your-app-with-newt">Orchestrating your app with
Newt</h2>
<p>Newt is configured with a YAML file. Currently the configuration file
uses five main attributes and a collection of sub attributes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>htdocs</dt>
<dd>
The path to the htdocs directory holding any static assets (e.g. CSS,
JavaScript, HTML files, image assets)
</dd>
<dt>env</dt>
<dd>
A list of environment variables available to Newt’s routes and models
(this is how Newt avoids storing secrets)
</dd>
<dt>routes</dt>
<dd>
An object describing the mapping of an HTTP request to JSON data source
and and optional Pandoc server processing
</dd>
<dt>namespace</dt>
<dd>
This is the schema name used to interact with PostgREST+Postgres
</dd>
<dt>models</dt>
<dd>
This is a list of data models used by Newt to generate bootstrap SQL
code for PostgREST+Postgres. The markup will be models is based on
GitHub YAML issues template syntax.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>htdocs</strong> just points at a standard directory
holding your static web content. It has no sub attributes.</p>
<p>The <strong>env</strong> attributes holds a list of environment
variable names that can be used by Newt when defining
<strong>routes</strong>.</p>
<p>Under <strong>routes</strong> you will also use the following
attributes</p>
<dl>
<dt>var</dt>
<dd>
(optional) A list of variable names and types used in validating a
request path or web from submission
</dd>
<dt>req_path</dt>
<dd>
A expression describing a URL path received by Newt (typical made by a
web browser or proxied from the front end web server)
</dd>
<dt>req_method</dt>
<dd>
An HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) related to the
req_path being handled
</dd>
<dt>api_url</dt>
<dd>
The URL expression used by Newt to contact the JSON data source for the
route described by req_path and req_method. Newt can communicate using
one of two protocols identified in the URL, <code>http://</code> or
<code>s3://</code>.
</dd>
<dt>api_method</dt>
<dd>
The HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) of the JSON data
source associated api_url for the given route
</dd>
<dt>api_content_type</dt>
<dd>
The HTTP content type expression used when submitting the request to the
JSON data source
</dd>
<dt>template</dt>
<dd>
(optional) The path to the pandoc or mustache template used to process
the results of the JSON data source request results
</dd>
<dt>render_port</dt>
<dd>
(optional) Set the port to use for contacting the render engine. If not
set it assume 3030 is the port for the render engine.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <strong>models</strong> attribute holds a list of models
expressed in Newt’s data model DSL. The original protype DSL is going to
be replaced with the YAML described in <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms">Syntax
for Github’s form schema</a>. That syntax will allow the creation of
<code>newtform</code> to generate web forms as well as be used by
<code>newtpg</code> to generate Postgres compatible SQL models and
behaviors. Here is an example using the old syntax as a placeholder.</p>
<h3 id="handling-errors">Handling errors</h3>
<p>Newt command vets the initial request before contacting the JSON data
source. If the request has a problem it will return an appropriate HTTP
status code and message. If the request to the JSON data source has a
problem, it will pass through the HTTP status code and message provided
by the JSON data source. Likewise if Pandoc server has a problem Newt
will forward that HTTP status code and message. If either the JSON data
source or Pandoc server is unavailable Newt will return a “Gateway” http
status code and message.</p>
<h3 id="static-file-support">Static file support</h3>
<p>Newt command first checks if a request is matched in one of the
defined routes. If not it’ll try to service the content from the
“htdocs” location if that is defined in the configuration. If the file
is not found or an htdocs directory has not been specified a http status
of 404 is returned.</p>
<p>Note Newt’s static file services are very basic. You can’t configure
mime type responses or modify behavior via “htaccess” files. If Newt is
running behind a traditional web server like Apache 2 or NginX then you
could use that service to host your static content providing additional
flexibilty.</p>
<h3 id="handling-secrets-scaling-and-limitations">Handling secrets,
scaling and limitations</h3>
<p>Newt’s YAML file does not explicitly contain any secrets. This was
intentional. You may need to pass sensitive data to your JSON data
source for access (e.g. credentials like a username and password). This
should be provided via the environment and the YAML file needs to
include these environment variable names in the “env” attribute. The
environment variables can be used to construct the URLs to contact the
JSON or S3 data sources. There is still a risk in that theoretically
that data source could echo return sensitive information. Newt can’t
prevent that. Newt is naive in its knowledge of the data source content
it receives or hands off to Pandoc. You’re responsible for securing
sensitive information at the database or s3 data source level. Follow
the recommendations in the Postgres community around securing
Postgres.</p>
<p>While Newt was conceived to be used on as a small scale web
application platform for libraries, archives and museums it is capable
of scaling big as long as your data source(s) can scale big. Using the
initial “Newt stack” elements can all be run easily behind load
balancers and in parallel across machines. Newt is transactional. It
does not require synchronized or shared of data between instances.
Similarly PostgREST and Pandoc services are transactional and do not
require shared state to function in parallel. Postgres itself can be
configured in a HA cluster to support high availability and high demand.
It should be possible to scale a Newt based application as large as
those systems can be scaled.</p>
<p>Presently Newt does not supports file uploads. The plan is to
integrated support for an S3 object store. That support is still very
much in the planning stages.</p>
<p>Newt command runs exclusively as a localhost service. In a production
setting you’d run Newt behind a traditional web server like Apache 2 or
NginX. The front end web service can provide access control via basic
auth or single sign-on (e.g. Shibboleth). Newt plays nicely in a
container environment, running as a system service or invoked from the
command line.</p>
