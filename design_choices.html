<h2 id="newt-design-choices">Newt design choices</h2>
<p>Newt needs to help make it trivial to quickly generate metadata
curation applications. It needs to leverage existing software and
knowledge.</p>
<p>I know Newt needs to play well with the following software.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a> + <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a></li>
<li><a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a></li>
</ul>
<p>JSON data is the way I want to work with structured data coming out
of these system. I also want to minize any additional middleware needed
to assemble a base metadata curation app featuring the basic CRUD-L<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> operatins. I want assembling my web
application to be conceptually as easy as working with Unix pipels in
the shell. An example would be to retrieve data from a JSON API
(e.g. the software above) and then run it through a simple minimal
template engine. I can see cases, based on my prior experiece with
Pandoc server, there way be more than two stage in the processing
sequence. I need a data workflow, a pipeline. We do this all the time in
web applications but often it is browser side, e.g. CrossRef and ORCID
data pulled in via JavaScript. I don’t want to rely on the web browser
so I need a pipeline behind the web server. I need a data router.</p>
<p>Since Pandoc server isn’t my ticket I started to look at other simple
template languages. Mustache is one I remember from both browser side
implementations and server side when I was working with PHP application
at USC. Mustache is alive and kicking and is supported by most of the
programming languages I’m likely to run into in libraries, archives and
museum organizations. There a good, maintained, Mustache package for Go
which is my implementation language for Newt. I can take the lessons
learned using Pandoc server and apply them to a template engine as part
of the Newt project. It will be separate from the data router so it can
be easily swapped out if someone doesn’t like Mustache. It needs to take
the JSON object or array from a data source and transform it. So the
configuration for the Mustache template engine needs to be part of the
YAML used in a Newt project.</p>
<p>This all implies three tools for Newt’s second prototype</p>
<ul>
<li>data router supporting the pipeline concept</li>
<li>template engine that plays well with the data router</li>
<li>a code generator that understands Newt’s YAML syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>This is buildable.</p>
<p>It lets us leverage systems like Postgres and PostgREST. Newt can
lower the SQL burden through code generation while keeping the data
modeling and management in the database (a core Newt philosophy). Using
a single YAML for data modeling means one sorce for both web form
generation and for SQL generation. Here’s what I need at the top level
of my YAML</p>
<ul>
<li>application metatadata and runtime settings (e.g. port numbers,
directories, OS environment to leverage)</li>
<li>models to describe the web forms and SQL needed from the
database</li>
<li>routes describing what the data router will listen for
<ul>
<li>pipelines identifying the services and contact requirements to
process the data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>templates a mapping of template requests to template processing the
received JSON data</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing the second prototype will help fill in the details guided
by these observations.</p>
