<h1 id="preface-the-newt-experiment-february-2024">Preface, the Newt
Experiment, February 2024</h1>
<p>The Newt Project was started in 2023. The first prototype was
implemented and culminated with a <a
href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/newt/presentation/">presentation</a>
to the SoCal Code4Lib group. The lessons learned from the presentation
included</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres+PostgREST was exciting (expected)</li>
<li>SQL was a problem for many people (expected)</li>
<li>Pandoc didn’t ring a bell with the web developers (a surprise)</li>
<li>A service that combined only Postgres+PostgREST with Pandoc server
wasn’t compelling</li>
</ul>
<p>What was nice about presenting was the excellent and supportive feed
back. It is all positive because it set me on a better path. It helped
me understand why my colleagues were politely ambivolent to my Newt. I
wasn’t about the amphibian.</p>
<h2 id="summer-fall-2023">Summer, Fall 2023</h2>
<p>By the time I had wrapped up coding the first prototype I was
successfully generating Postgres SQL and PostgREST configuration files.
I was troubled by my horrible choices in the YAML syntax I had evolved.
You had to know too much about SQL and specifically Postgres. My YAML
syntax was a complete mess.</p>
<p>I continued to experiment with Pandoc server. While it is capable and
cleverly simple it wasn’t particularly fun to work with. If you send
invalid JSON you get an error message. This is very helpful. When you
sent it a valid JSON POST and Pandoc returns an empty request body it is
really hard to see where you went wrong. I found that a completely
frustrating experience. I could not ask others to live with that.</p>
<p>My YAML is horrible and Pandoc is out, what next?</p>
<h2 id="fall-2023-thru-january-2024">Fall 2023 thru January 2024</h2>
<p>I kept purcolating on Newt. Was I building a solution to a problem
only I had? I dreaded writing yet another metadata curation app. I had
three scheduled to be written and that waa three too many. I was left
pondering. Is it me or do web applications really need to be complex?
Surely there is a simpler way. Or di that vanish with the late
Prof. Niklaus Wirth?</p>
<p>I needed a clean slate, a new prototype. What should that look
like?</p>
<h2 id="february-2024-a-second-prototype">February 2024, a second
prototype</h2>
<p>My motivating insight came from a cool demo by my colleague <a
href="https://library.caltech.edu/about/directory">Tommy Keswick</a>
gave for a project he did with Caltech Archives. He showed the GitHub
YAML issue syntax<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> needed to use GitHub issues to
trigger GitHub workflows. When I saw how the syntax setup the data
needed for the actions it struck a chord. That is what I needed for
describing my data models. I don’t know who designed the GitHub YAML
issue template syntax but they did a really good job. It feels like
you’re talking about the elements in a web form. That means as a web
developer I’m building on elements and concepts that are second nature.
I reread the documenetation at <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types">MDN</a>
for HTML5 form element types. The light buld turned on. I could infer
directly using the GitHub YAML issue template syntax (abbr: GHYTS) the
SQL I needed in Postgres or SQLite3 to hold the data. GHYTS can indeed
be used as a modeling language targeting an SQL database. Of course it
is designed to model an HTML form so that problem gets solved too.</p>
<p>My sage colleage <a
href="https://library.caltech.edu/about/directory">Mike Hucka</a>
pointed to me the problems of inventing new languages, even new domain
spefic languages. When you invent a new language or new DSL you are
increasing cognative load on your the developer. By using GHYTS I side
step that problem. Our developers already know how to create the issue
temaplates on GitHub. I am repurposing that knowledge for code
generation to build a custom application. Time to start thinking through
the specifics of the new prototype.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-prototype">The second prototype</h2>
<p>Newt tools need configuration. YAML is the language used to express
that configuration. Newt’s second prototype uses CITATION.cff to
describe the application mentadata for the Newt based project. Actually
all it needs is to point to the CITATION.cff<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and
the metadata about the application you’re creating is complete. The
horrible part of the first YAML for the first prototype was the modeling
syntax. GHYTS solves that. What’s left to learn is much easier to
describe. It’s how to route the data and how to provide templates
support. But I am getting ahead of my story so I’ll leave that for the
next section.</p>
