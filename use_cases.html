Currating Caltech People, Groups and Funders</h2>
<p>In 2021 a web application called <a
href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/acacia">Acacia</a> was built
with a Go web service that mapped database access to a JSON API and use
static files to access the JSON API and present a web based input system
for lists of DOI sent to Caltech Library via EMail. The web app provided
views to process the requests based on a queue table and hosted in a
MySQL 8 database. This proved reliable but the burden of relying on
JavaScript to assemble the web presentation was problematic in terms of
accessibly support. This meant the approach wasn’t suitable for public
web services offered by the library. Additional building the UI via
JavaScript did not reduce development time.</p>
<p>A similar approach was to be taken with cold, built initially in
Python but contraints on developer time prevented completion of the
project and managing simple table oriented data was found to be easier
in a spreadsheet inspite of the problematic interface with a model that
included a high number of columns.</p>
<p>In 2024 we are revisiting <a
href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/cold">cold</a> taking the Newt
approach knowing that many more custom applications like Acacia and cold
are in our future.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>cold is expected to maintain three types of objects. A list of
Caltech people, a list of Caltech groups and a list of Caltech funders.
It will need to render YAML lists for import into RDM as controlled
vocabulariees and as a source of what to aggregate in our feeds website.
The latter is used to allow facularty, staff and researchers to
integrate their publication lists via the centrally provided content
management system (they use a JavaScript widget to include data from
Caltech Library’s feeds).</p>
<p>Additionally cold is moving beyond a flat spreadsheet oriented data
model to a tree oriented one. E.g. A author may use multiple name
variations over time. An organization’s name may change or evolve or
time. It is desirable to track the alternatives. This make continued
curation of this data in a CSV file problematic at best. Furtunately
storing lists in a database such as Postgres is well understood and the
Newt platform using Postgres+PostgREST in a pipeline can support this
type of content curation.</p>
<p>For Newt to be helpful to deliver cold the SQL needed to manage the
database in Postgres should be generated from the data models supported
in cold. Similar the web forms and content display should be deliverable
via code generation. The Postgres+PostgREST JSON API means integrating
content into other systems that rely on that data is just a web request
away without having to change cold or the system using it’s data.</p>
<h3 id="developer-experience">Developer experience</h3>
<p>Development cold is scheduled for Spring/Summer 2024</p>
<h2
id="evolving-feeds-beyond-1.5-by-leveraging-data-pipelines-to-render-static-content">Evolving
feeds beyond 1.5 by leveraging data pipelines to render static
content</h2>
<p>Moving from our original implementation of feeds.library.caltech.edu
to version 1.5 with support for RDM repositories has been problematic
and plague by bug regresions. Cleaning of legacy technical dept while
maintaining backward compatibility has bogged the project down. What was
originally planed to be a month of development in September 2023 has
stretched into February 2024 with no end in site. It has become a case
of whack a mole.</p>
<p>The feeds process original was batch oriented with updates aggregated
nightly. The buggy feeds v1.5 has allowed us to run updated aggregation
once a twelve hours. This remains dismal as well as very difficult to
debug. Bring down the build time to an hour or two would greatly improve
the situtation. The performance bottle necks are largely in the time it
takes to write aggregations to disk, read them back in then great the
next smaller set of aggregations. This currently is done in a Python
orchestrated and Shell.</p>
<p>Newt offers an escape hatch through its pipeline approach. Each level
of aggregation can be thought of as a SQL VIEW. This can be generated in
JSON directly by Postgres+PostgREST. The results can be stored in feeds
database table. Similarly the JSON can be sent through a template
engine, either Pandoc or Newt’s Mustache engine, to render other formats
(e.g. HTML, HTML include, BibTeX, RSS, CSV). This pushes all the sorting
and structing problem into the database which is better suited than hand
coded Python scripts to aggregate content. The resulting JSON, HTML,
HTML include, BibTeX, RSS and CSV can be either written to disk in batch
or pushed directly into an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>This pipeline approach also means render one section of the feeds
website becomes easily isolated by treating the build process as a
webhook driven by a client script.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both use cases are theoretical at this time because the 2nd Newt
prototype has not been implemented</p>
