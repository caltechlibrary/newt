title: "Newt"
abstract: "Newt is an experimental rapid application development toolbox
for creating metadata curation applications. Newt applications implement
a service orient architecture to minimize the code you have to write and
maintain. The Newt approach emphasizes off the shelf components. Newt
comes with a data router, a stateless template engine and a developer
tool. The developer tool includes data modeler, code generator and app
runner. Data models are described in YAML similar to a YAML description
of a web form. The code generator targets SQL and conf files for running
Postgres plus PostgREST. It can generate handlebar templates from your
modeled data, create the data routes needed as well as generate
templates and map them for the template engine. The data router
implements a data pipeline concept where the JSON output of one web
service is be fed into the next (conceptually similar to Unix pipes).
While the developer tool targets Postgres, PostgREST and Newtâ€™s template
engine other JSON data sources such as Solr can be integrated by manual
editing of the Newt YAML file. The data router provides support for
serving static files in additional to the content generated from a data
pipeline."
