<h1 id="newt-generator-explained">Newt Generator Explained</h1>
<p>Newt comes with a code generator called <code>newtgenerator</code>.
It uses the Newt YAML file to render Postgres SQL, PostgREST
configuration and Mustache templates suitable to bootstrap your Newt
based project. How does it do this? What are the assumptions?</p>
<p>The Newt code generator works primarily with the “models” property in
your Newt YAML file.</p>
<p>Our minimal useful application should be able to do five things -
Create, Read, Update, Delete and List (abbr: CRUD-L). It needs to offer
these actions for each model defined in our project. The second Newt
prototype assumes each model is independent. If you need to combine
models (not unusual) then you will need to enhance the generated SQL.
For now let us focus on the basics.</p>
<p>In the Newt philosophy we model our data and manage our data in the
database. For us this means Postgres. By combining Postgres and
PostgREST we create a JSON API based on what we’ve modeled and managed
in our database. Our middleware, the stages in our pipelines, do not
need to know anything about SQL. They don’t ever touch it. This gives us
a clean break from SQL and the rest of our system. It avoids the burden
of doing the cognitive shifts when implementing middleware. This is a
result of Postgres plus PostgREST automatically giving a JSON API.
Clever stuff really.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-up-postgrespostgrest">Bringing up
Postgres+PostgREST</h2>
<p>Postgres and PostgREST provide us with a JSON API that can be used in
a Newt router pipeline. Following the Newt philosophy data modeling and
management happen in the database. That is done via the SQL language
which the Newt generator can produce. After the database is setup in
Postgres with the scheme, tables, functions and views needed for basic
CRUD-L operations you can generate a compatible PostgREST configuration
file. Here’s the steps I follow after creating my Newt YAML file.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the Postgres database and schema<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> if
they don’t exist</li>
<li>For each Newt model create a table in the database/scheme</li>
<li>For each Newt model create a function for each of the CRUD<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> options<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>For each Newt model create a SQL view to handle the list view of the
CRUD-L</li>
<li>Generate a PostgREST configuration file.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: The generator always generates it’s output to standard out.
Errors, if they occur are sent to standard error. This makes it easy to
script the Newt generator in shell or in a Makefile.</p>
<h3 id="generating-some-sql">Generating some SQL</h3>
<p>Let’s turn our attention to setting up Postgres database. Several
things need to be accomplished and the Newt generator will generate the
SQL needed for all of them. It will even generate the SQL to make
managing your content via PostgREST JSON API easier.</p>
<p>OK, now that we know what we’re generating lets generate this SQL
from our app.yaml. We’ll save the SQL output in a file called
“app.sql”</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newtgenerator postgres app.yaml &gt;app.sql</code></pre>
<p>In the statement above “postgres” tells the generator target the
Postgres database SQL dialect.</p>
<p>Take a look at “app.sql”. Notice that the SQL if the code contains
comments. If you’ve included the <code>.description</code> attributes in
our models then the SQL also includes them. This means you can continue
improving the SQL manually if you like. Another approach would be to
create a second SQL file with your modifications and use SQL
<code>alter</code> or <code>drop</code> statements where you need to
augment or replace the Newt generated parts.</p>
<p>This is a text that explains Postgres database so I am going to keep
this short. If you want to read about Postgres to better understand it I
recommend the <a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres website</a> or the
book <a href="https://theartofpostgresql.com/"
title="website for the book">The Art of Postgres</a>. is heavily
commented, those your</p>
<p>What was generated? The specifics will depend on what was in the
“app.yaml” file, specifically the models property. Do you see comments
you the generate SQL file? These were form from the
<code>.description</code> properties found in the YAML. By taking the
time to add description properties are making the generated code more
human friendly. While these are optional properties they are really
handy when you evolve the code generator or come back to a project
later.</p>
<p>The first section of the SQL generate should have statements to
create the database if it doesn’t exist and to create a name space if it
doesn’t exist. Next you should see SQL for creating tables, one for each
model. Then you should see the creation of views. The SQL views fill the
role of the “L” in the acronym CRUD-L.</p>
<p>The nice things about having views is it make it easy to see what our
application will see when accessing the JSON API to list objects based
on our models. This parity becomes very helpful when you are extending
your application or trying to debug why the JSON API isn’t giving you
what you expected. A view is accessed through the SQL
<code>select</code> statement.</p>
<p>After a model’s view Newt will generate functions for create, read,
update and delete. Why do this? First it allows us a consistent
abstraction should the underlying data model change in the future.
Second you can enhance the function to perform additional validation if
needed. Example, let’s say you’ve imported the Python library idutils
into Postgres. You can use that library to validate identifiers like
DOI, ORCID, ROR, arXiv, ISNI, etc. Since the operation is a “function”
rather than an SQL procedure you can let the requestor there was a
problem or take actions to mitigate it. A function can keep the
conversation going with the web browser at the other end of the
wire.</p>
<p>You might be wondering about how things are name. The functions and
view names are formed from the model name appended with “_”, followed by
the action. Newt tries to give you a robust bootstrap. One of the ways
that it accomplishes that is by naming things predictably. This improves
code readability for us humans.</p>
<p>After defining the models tables, views and functions the end of the
generated SQL sets up the access needed by PostgREST to provide the JSON
API. Essentially that is a block of permission granting statements. When
you read through these you need to understand them and make sure they
comply with your organization’s database practices. Newt is only making
a guess what is OK for you. See the PostgREST website for more
information about how Postgres and PostgREST work together, <a
href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/"
class="uri">https://postgrest.org/en/stable/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="generate-our-postgrest-configuration">Generate our PostgREST
configuration</h3>
<p>The generator can generate a PostgREST configuration file,
<code>postgrest.conf</code>. This is the first step. Next step is to
setup our Postgres database to model our data, manage our data and to
allow PostgREST to access our database appropriately. This is all done
via SQL. So how to we generate. To generate the
<code>postgrest.conf</code> you use the newtgenerator with a YAML file
named “app.yaml” you would do the following.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newtgenerator postgrest app.yaml &gt;postgrest.conf</code></pre>
<p>In the above command the “postgrest” (note the “t” at the end) tells
the generator what needs to be generated. In this a Postgrest
configuration because that is what PostgREST needs.</p>
<h2 id="ready-for-testing-our-json-api">Ready for testing our JSON
API</h2>
<p>At this point we have defined a predictable JSON API and set of
related URLs we can use in our data pipelines. You should now have three
files in our application directory, two were generated by the Newt
generator.</p>
<ul>
<li>app.yaml, you created this by typing it in or copying an example and
modifying it for your needs</li>
<li>postgrest.conf was generated by Newt and holds a configuration used
when you startup PostgREST</li>
<li>app.sql is the SQL file that sets up Postgres to work with our
application</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we need to set things in motion. You can load your SQL into
Postgres via the Postgres REPL called <code>psql</code>. You’ll need to
have administrative privileges to run the SQL as it will create a new
database for your application. See <a
href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html"
class="uri">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html</a>
about creating database users for details.</p>
<p>On my computer I have Postgres 16 running and my personal account has
admin privileges so I use <code>psql</code> like this to create the
database, schema, tables, views, functions and permissions needed for
the my application.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>psql &lt; app.sql</code></pre>
<p>If that worked then we can try out starting PostgREST and use <a
href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> to see if our JSON API works. The exact
URL will be dependent on the database and model names setup in Postgres.
The PostgREST webpage explains the JSON API, see <a
href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api.html"
class="uri">https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api.html</a>. If
I have created a model named “people” I can start PostgREST then test of
it is available like this.</p>
<pre><code>postgrest postgrest.conf &amp;
curl http://localhost:3000/people</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: This first command starts PostgREST as a back ground process,
you need to kill it if the data base changes table definitions, views or
you’ve added views, tables or functions. See the PostgREST documentation
for details about when you need to restart PostgREST, <a
href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/schema_cache.html"
class="uri">https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/schema_cache.html</a>.</p>
<p>That should return a list of people. Since our database tables aren’t
populated it should be an empty list. At this point I suggest getting
comfortable with Postgres and PostgREST. While the generator creates the
SQL and configuration needed that doesn’t substitute for understanding
how it is working and actually how you might want to use it!</p>
<h2 id="generating-some-templates-for-a-web-ui">Generating some
templates for a web UI</h2>
<p>Newt comes with a light weight template engine called Newt Mustache.
It implements Mustache templates. The Newt generator knows how to
generate those. Newt can generate a template for each of our CRUD-L
operations for each model. To know what template you want to generate
you need to tell the generator you want to generate mustache templates,
which model you generating it for and what action the template will
model. As mentioned previously Newt generator writes the generated code
to standard output and errors if encountered to standard error. Like
with generating SQL and a configuration file this allows for flexibility
in scripting via shell or a Makefile. Here’s an example of the commands
I type to create the templates for our people model.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newtgenerator mustache people create &gt;people_create.tmpl
newtgenerator mustache people read &gt;people_read.tmpl
newtgenerator mustache people update &gt;people_update.tmpl
newtgenerator mustache people delete &gt;people_delete.tmpl
newtgenerator mustache people list &gt;people_list.tmpl</code></pre>
<p>If you examine the resulting templates you’ll notice that create,
update and delete include webforms and use the model types you describe.
On the other hand the templates for read and list do not include
webforms just some standard markup elements. I expect you’ll want to
enhance these to meet you applications need but they should function
well enough to test your data pipelines and debug them.</p>
<p>I usually get the back end setup and tested before moving to make the
application pretty and enhancing the browser experience.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to testing your templates. One is to use
them as the last stage of your JSON API. Another is to configure the
templates in your YAML and run Newt Mustache service and use curl. In in
the example below I’m assuming you’ve mocked up a person record in a
JSON file called person.json. We can then test come of our templates to
see how they fit the bill. I’m assuming you’ve setup Newt Mustache to
provide templates based on the names of the templates. I am also
assuming Newt Mustache is running on port 8040 in this example.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newtmustache app.yaml &amp;
curl --data &#39;@people.json&#39; http://localhost:8040/people_read.html</code></pre>
<p>You should get back an HTML page with the content of “person.json” in
it. If so that template is working. The create template should return an
empty web form as it is used to “create” new model instances and a model
idea isn’t available. If the “person.json” JSON included an object id
then you should see it in the update form as a hidden field. Update
should not enable creating new objects in must cases. Similarly if you
mock up a list of people in a JSON file called “people.json” then you
should be able to test the list template too.</p>
<p>I generally will work directly with mock up JSON files and Newt
Mustache to get the web interface I want for my application.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Newt Mustache reads the templates in
at program start. If you revise your templates you need to
<strong>restart</strong> Newt Mustache. In this way Newt Mustache and
Newt Router are like PostgREST server that you will need to be
comfortable stopping and start the services as you continue your
development.</p>
