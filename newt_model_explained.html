<h1 id="newts-newt-command">Newt’s <code>newt</code> command</h1>
<p>The core of Newt is the command <code>newt</code>. It handles the
following for your Newt based project.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate a Newt YAML file through an interactive dialog using the
“config” action.</li>
<li>Generate and manage your models through an interactive dialog</li>
<li>Create an manage the initial routing in your Newt Application based
on your models</li>
<li>Generate a PostgREST configuration file, SQL files as well as
Mustache templates</li>
<li>Manage the generated templates in your Newt YAML file</li>
<li>Run Newt Router, Newt Mustache and PostgREST so you can test and
develop your application</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>newt</code> command is a development tool. It simplifies
standing up a Newt application built around the Newt Router, Newt
Mustache template engine and Postgres+PostgREST. A <code>newt</code>
generated application will provide the basic create, read, update,
delete and list operations you need for managing the metadata described
by your models.</p>
<h2 id="the-newt-yaml-file">The Newt YAML file</h2>
<p>The Newt YAML file is made of four major properties</p>
<dl>
<dt>applications</dt>
<dd>
Holds configuration information for PostgREST, Newt Router and Newt
Mustache template engine
</dd>
<dt>models</dt>
<dd>
This holds the data models your application will implement, this
property is inspired by the <a href="">GitHub YAML issue template
syntax</a>
</dd>
<dt>routes</dt>
<dd>
These are the request Newt Router will manage they are descriptions of
HTTP method and path along with any data pipeline processing needed to
respond to HTTP request
</dd>
<dt>templates</dt>
<dd>
This holds the configuration for the Newt Mustache template engine. The
template engine accepts POST requests and associates Mustache templates
with a given request path. Mustache templates support the concept of
“partial” templates, these are also specified in relationship to the
request path and primary template association. Templates are read in
with Newt Mustache starts and are not re-read until you restart Newt
Mustache.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="create-an-configure-your-newt-yaml-file">Create an configure
your Newt YAML file</h2>
<p>The <code>newt</code> command supports an “config” action. This will
create or update a Newt YAML file. It does this through a dialog of
questions which you provide answers for. Based on the answers then the
Newt YAML file will be modified to reflect your answers. Before the Newt
YAML file is written to disk you will be prompted if it is OK to save
the name file. If the file already exists than the old one will be
renamed with a “.bak” file extension. If a “.bak” file exist it will be
replaced.</p>
<p>Here is an example of creating a “app.yaml” file using the “config”
action.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newt config app.yaml</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: You can press “control C” to quit the “config” action without
writing the YAML to disk.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-your-data">Modeling your data</h2>
<p>The <code>newt</code> command provides an “model” action. This lets
you add, modify or remove a data model from your Newt YAML file. Like
the “config” action it will provide you with the opportunity to review
changes before writing them to disk.</p>
<p>The modeling process is more complex than the “config” action. You
may have model than one model, you may have many properties per model.
As a result the dialog between you and <code>newt model</code> is
separated into stages. First you are asked to manage the model(s) by
either adding or removing them. You can then “modify” a model where it
will allow you to add or remove a list of model properties. Each model
will have at least one property, the “oid” property. “oid” stands for
object indentifier. By default an object identifier is represented as a
UUID. In string form these can be long but they allow for millions of
object to be managed. If you prefer a shorter string representaition for
your object identifiers these can be selected but you cannot remove the
object identifier from the model. It remains required.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-dialog">Top level dialog</h3>
<p>The top level dialog lets you perform one of four different actions.
Add a model, Modify a model, Remove a model and quit. The top level
dialog will list any models hat are defined.</p>
<p>When you choose “add model” you will then be prompted for a model
identifier. This identifier must start with an alphabetical character
followed by one or more alphanumeric characters or underscore
characters. E.g. “my_bird_list” is an example of a valid model name
while “2bots!” is not a valid name. In Postgres the model id will be
used as the Postgres table name. The model id will also will be used to
form the Mustache template names by the Newt code generator. Model names
must be unique inside your application.</p>
<p>When you see one or models listed you less an integer to the left. If
you type the integer (or type our the model name) you then will be asked
if you want to “modify” or “remove” the model. Type “m” will let you
modify the model, Type “r” to remove it. When you remove a model you
will be taken back to the top level dialog. If you type “m” to modify
the model you will be taken to the modify model dialog.</p>
<p>Typing “s” will save the current state of the models to your Newt
YAML file. Typing “q” will save then “quit” the modeler completely.
Typing “c” for cancel will exit the modeler without saving changes.</p>
<h3 id="modifying-a-model">Modifying a model</h3>
<p>The modify model dialog will show you a list of properties associated
with the model. A model must always have an “oid” (i.e. object
identifier) property. While you can’t remove the object identifier
property you can modify it’s type. Currently an “oid” defaults to a UUID
(native to Postgres) but you many choose to use a <a
href="https://github.com/lithammer/shortuuid">shortuuid/v4</a> stored as
a 22 character string, <a
href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/bson/objectid">Mongo
BON ObjectID</a> stored as a 24 character string.</p>
<p>The modifying model view allows you to add a property, modify a
property or remove a property.</p>
<p>In the modify model dialog you can choose add a property, modify a
property or remove a property. To add a property type “a” and you will
be prompted to provide a property identifiers. This, like model
identifiers, needs to start with an alphabetical characters followed by
one or more alphanumeric characters or underscore. Press enter and you
are taken to the property dialog. By default the added property is of
“input” type. You can modify it to define different property attributes
such as different types of property.</p>
<p>If you want to modify or remove a property you can specify the
property by entering the integer to the left of the property name or my
typing the property. If you follow this by “m” then you’ll be taken to
the property modification dialog. If you type “r” it’ll remove the
property and if you press enter you will be taken back to the property
list for the current model.</p>
<p>Typing “s” will save the current model. Typing “q” will save then
take you back to the top level dialog. Typing “c” for cancel will return
to the top level dialog without saving the changes.</p>
<h3 id="property-dialog">Property dialog</h3>
<p>Modifying property has a similar interface to the models dialog and
the modify model dialog. It presents you with a list of current
attributes. It differs in that when you ave the options of select the
specific attribute of the property to modify. Note that what is
presented is tied to the type value of the property. The type
corresponds to the basic HTML input element types defined on at <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input">MDN</a>.
It also includes some customized input specific to the gallery, library,
archive and museum metadata domain. These will be expressed in as
standard HTML elements the Mustache templates but can be further vetted
from within Postgres via Python’s idutils package.</p>
<p>When you press enter when listing the property attributes it accepts
the current settings and take you back to the modify model dialog.
Typing “c” for cancel will take you back to he modify model dialog
without changing the property’s attributes.</p>
<p>If you type “m” to modify your model you when will be shown a list of
properties associated with the model. There will always be at least one
property, the “oid” or object identifier property. The object identifier
property is special. It can be modified but NOT removed. All models have
an “oid” property. By default the “type” is UUID for the object
identifier. UUID are a good way to support object identification in a
modern SQL database like Postgres. They have only one drawback. The way
we express the value of a UUID tends to be as a long string. This can be
unwieldy for URLs. You can choice an alternate identifier type that
results in sorter or numeric identifiers. The shorter identifiers limit
the total number of objects you can manage but typically these is not a
problem (e.g. Caltech Library’s Authors repository has 100,000 objects,
someday it might have 200,000 objects. Each object could still have a
unique identifiers of with a six or seven character string). Finally you
can also use an integer value which is incremented with each added
object. This tends to be short but comes at the expense of limiting you
to a single database instance in many cases.</p>
<p>Typing “s” will save the property settings. Tying “q” will save then
exit the property dialog. Typing “c” for cancel will exit the property
dialog without making changes.</p>
<h2 id="support-input-types">Support input types</h2>
<p>FIXME: Need to write up the basic supported input types and how they
related to presentations in HTML and SQL.</p>
