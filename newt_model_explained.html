<h1 id="newts-newt-model">Newt’s <code>newt model</code></h1>
<p>The model action does most of the heavy lifting short of actual code
generation. If you save the model(s) you will cause the models property
to be populated but also related propertes under the routes and
templates properties. Like <code>newt config</code> if you do not
provide a file name the command will assume you’re working with
“app.yaml”.</p>
<p>It is possible to run <code>newt model</code> before running
<code>newt config</code>. Whichever order you run them in they both need
to be run before you try <code>newt run</code>.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-your-data">Modeling your data</h2>
<p>The <code>newt model</code> lets you add, modify or remove a data
model from your Newt YAML file. Like the “config” action it will provide
you with the opportunity to review changes and before exiting saving the
changes to disk.</p>
<p>The modeling process is more complex than the “config” action. You
may have model than one model, you may have many properties per model.
As a result the dialog between you and <code>newt model</code> is
separated into stages. First you are asked to manage the model(s) by
either adding, modifying or removing them. When you add model it creates
an empty model. You can then “modify” the model which in turns allows
you to add or remove a list of model properties and elements. Each model
will have at least one element, the “oid” property. “oid” stands for
object indentifier. This is a unique identifier. When the SQL is
generated it will be set as a primary key. This is one place where you
may want to modify the generated SQL. There are lots of choices for
unique identifiers, e.g. auto increment values, UUID and other shorter
indentifiers more URL friendly. If you don’t want to use “oid” as your
object identifier you can remove it and designate another element as
being the primary key. At least one element in your model should be the
primary key to avoid problems.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can press “control C” to quit the “config” action without
writing the YAML to disk.</p>
<p>Let’s step through how the dialogs and menus are organized.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-dialog-manage-models">Top level dialog, “Manage
Models”</h3>
<p>The top level dialog is the “manage models” (note the plural). It has
a menu displayed after any models listed. The dialog’s menu lets you
perform one of four different actions. Add a model, modify a model,
remove a model and quit. The quit action at the top level will exit the
program if you don’t need to save changes. The top level model will list
any models hat are defined already. By default it is an empty list.</p>
<p>When you choose “add model” you will then be prompted for a model
identifier. This identifier must start with an alphabetical character
followed by one or more alphanumeric characters or underscore
characters. E.g. “my_bird_list” is an example of a valid model name
while “2bots!” is not a valid name. The reason for these restrictions is
the model id is used when generating SQL as well as when we generate
Mustache Templates. An example is in Postgres the model id will be used
as the Postgres table name. Model names must be unique inside your
application for the same reason that Postgres tables require uniqueness
in a given Postgres database.</p>
<p>The added model will then appear in your model list. An added modify
will be empty. You should proceed to “modify” that model after you’ve
added.</p>
<p>Models may also be removed. You may have as many models as you want.
Each will wind up with their own set of routes and templates that will
be used with the generated configuration, SQL and set of Mustache
templates.</p>
<h3 id="nd-level-dialog-manage-model">2nd level dialog, “Manage
model”</h3>
<p>The second level menu has a title like
<code>Manage &lt;MODEL_NAME&gt; model</code> where
<code>&lt;MODEL_NAME&gt;</code> is the name of the model you’re
modifying. You should update the description with a brief explanation of
what the model’s purpose is. This is used in the comments of the
generated SQL.</p>
<p>The dialog’s menu choices are description, elements and quit. The
elements are the important part of your model. If you think of your
model as a table elements would be columns. In object oriented jargon
these are usually called attributes or properties. The elements describe
a key/value relation between an element’s id and value stored.</p>
<p>The quit menu option exists the manage model dialog and takes you to
the top level dialog, “manage models”.</p>
<h3 id="rd-level-dialog-manage-elements">3rd level dialog, “Manage
Elements”</h3>
<p>If you have selected elements from the 2nd level dialog you will find
your self in the “manage element” dialog. This dialog lists any elements
that may have been defined. By default their is a “oid” unless you’ve
removed it. Like with the top level “manage models”. Managing elements
is much like managing models. The menu indicates you can add, modify,
remove and quit. Quit, just like the other dialog, lets you leave the
current diolog taking you to the second level dialog, “Manage Model”.
Add will let you add elements, remove will remove the elements. Modify
will let yo modify a specific element.</p>
<p>Like with models you first add an element then you modify it. The
defaults are probably not what you want unless your form is very
simple.</p>
<h3 id="th-level-dialog-manage-element">4th level dialog, “Manage
Element”</h3>
<p>When you select modify element from the 3rd level dialog “Manage
Elements” you can now define the specifics of the element. The menu in
this dialog as the following actions type, pattern, attributes, label
and primary key.</p>
<p>Conceptually you can think of an element as an HTML5 native input
element. There is a loose corrolation in the attribute names.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>[t]ype</code></dt>
<dd>
Sets the element type. The types are the same types supported by HTML5
native elements with the exception of “file”. Additionally there are
some library specific elements that leverage the “pattern” attribute
such as orcid and issn.
</dd>
<dt><code>[l]abel</code></dt>
<dd>
This is holds the value of any associated HTML label element linked to
the input element through the set attribute and input’s id attribute.
</dd>
<dt><code>[p]attern</code></dt>
<dd>
This is a regular expression used for browser side validation and when
generating SQL to validate submitted objects.
</dd>
<dt><code>[a]ttributes</code></dt>
<dd>
This holds an HTML5 specific attributes you may wish to include,
e.g. name, placeholdertext, title
</dd>
<dt><code>[o]bject key</code></dt>
<dd>
This holds true or false that this element is used as the primary key of
the modeled object. The dialog shows the current state. Selecting this
menu item toggles it.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>An elemenet’s properties have a loose corrolation with the native
HTML5 input elements attributes. E.g. id, type, pattern are based on the
HTML5 input element attributes. Primay key is bool value used when
generating SQL to indicate that this element should map to the primary
key of the model. You can have one primary key per model.</p>
<p>The types of elements are taken directly from what can be expressed
in native HTML5 elements excluding the “file” type. E.g. text, textarea,
select, checkbox, radio, button, date, time, datetime, email, phone, and
url. Additional are library oriented types like issn and orcid that use
the “pattern” attribute for client side validation. The element types
infer the SQL columns modeled your Newt application.</p>
<p>The attributes menu option lets you add any additional HTML specific
attributes you may need. E.g. required, class, placeholdertext,
title.</p>
<p>The select element type triggers an additional dialog since it the
HTML of the select element has “option” elements as children.</p>
<h3 id="th-level-dialog-manage-options">5th level dialog, “Manage
Options”</h3>
<p>This menu lets you provide a value, label and default flag for the
options in the select element. The dialog’s menu lets you add, modify,
remove and quit.</p>
<p>When you add an option you will be prompted for a value, a label and
optional default status. The value will get converted to lower case. The
label will be left as you typed it.</p>
<p>When you modify or remove an option you do so by provided the number
of options listed since options values are not necessarily unique.</p>
<h2 id="walking-through-the-process">Walking through the process</h2>
<h3 id="adding-a-model">Adding a model</h3>
<p>Let’s fireup <code>newt model</code> and add a model called
“garden”.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newt model</code></pre>
<p>You should now see the following menu.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>Enter menu letter and id


Menu [a]dd, [m]odify, [r]emove, [q]uit (making changes)</code></pre>
<p>Type the letter “a” and press the enter key.</p>
<p>You will see</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>Enter model id to add:</code></pre>
<p>Enter “garden” without the quotes and then press the enter key.</p>
<p>You should now see</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>Enter menu letter and id

    1: garden

Menu [a]dd, [m]odify, [r]emove, [q]uit (making changes)</code></pre>
<p>You’ve successfully created an empty model called “garden”.</p>
<p>If you want to see what is in the model or to modify it you would
select “m” for modify model.</p>
<h3 id="modifying-our-garden-model">Modifying our “garden” model</h3>
<p>The modify model menu will show you a list of properties associated
with the model. When you created our “garden” model it automatically
created an “oid”, object identifier, element in the model. We’re going
to get rid of this and create a new one.</p>
