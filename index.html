<h1 id="newt-a-new-take-of-the-web-stack">Newt, a new take of the web
stack</h1>
<p>Newt is my short for “new take” on building web applications from a
few off the shelf micro services. The micro services newt explores are
<a href="https://postgresql.org">Postgres</a>, <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a>, <a
href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc server</a>, Newt a minimalist URL
request router.</p>
<p>My belief is that many web services and sites used by Archives,
Libraries and Museums can benefit from a simplier back-end that allows
the application developer to focus on the front-end that impacts both
our staff and patrons.</p>
<p>The Newt’s vision is to define data models and route handling via SQL
queries, views, functions and procedure (via Postgres+PostgREST),
leverage Pandoc server for templating needs and a light weigth URL
router that can use both PostgREST and Pandoc to return dynmamic content
or static content from the local file system. In this way both developer
and technical staff and develop interactive websites and services
without having to know more than SQL, HTML and a little JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-postgres-and-postgrest">Introducing Postgres and
PostgREST</h2>
<p>To understand Newt you need to first understand how much you can do
with just Postgres and PostgREST. The demo <a href="birds/">birds</a>
builds a simple bird spotting web site. It uses PostgREST as a JSON data
API and front end web server (specifically
<code>python3 -m http http.server</code>) to present static web pages
that interact with the PostgREST service. The purpose of the demo is to
show how to develop using Postgres 15 and PostgREST 11 and static
files.</p>

<h2 id="pandoc-server-a-powerful-template-engine">Pandoc server, a
powerful template engine</h2>
<p>This second demo, <a href="bees/">bees</a>, builds on the birds demo
by adding Pandoc server as a template engine for rendering content
retrieved from Postgres via PostgREST. Pandoc service provide much the
capability of the Pandoc command line program to a simple and safe
localhost web service. In bees we are presenting a bee spotting
application with reports rendered via data from POstgREST and processed
by Pandoc server.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-newt-a-minimalist-url-router">Introducing Newt, a
minimalist URL router</h2>
<p>There are times when relying on JavaScript in the web browser to
assemble a web page is not appropriate. In development it is also a
hassle to run a full blown front end web server like Apache 2 or NginX.
The Newt URL router tries to remedy this by allowing you to
programtically define the routes your website will support what
accomodating web page assembly (via PostgREST and Pandoc server) and
static file services for content. In this penultimate demo called <a
href="flowers/">flowers</a>. A service that tracks flowers. It is build
via SQL, Pandoc templates and static files. Unlike our previous two
examples the web pages is assembled server side so no JavaScript is
required in the web browser. While Newt doesn’t current support file
uploads it does support building dynamic websites and services where the
data is held in Postgres.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In this final demo, now including the Newt URL router, we use SQL to
define our back-end service, Pandoc (via Pandoc server) to format our
dynamic web poages and static files to complete our website
implementation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In all our demos we’ve devided the tasks through a series of flexible
micro services can can be used individually or in combination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres, data storage, back-end configuration and data
services</li>
<li>PostgREST, a JSON data API</li>
<li>Pandoc server as a template engine</li>
<li>Newt a URL router for PostgREST, Pandoc server and static files</li>
<li>(in production setting) a front end web server providing access
control and user authentication (e.g. Apache2, NginX)</li>
</ul>
<p>The “coding” left to someone developing a website or service can be
as minimal as knowning some SQL, HTML and Pandoc.</p>
