<h1 id="newt">Newt</h1>
<p>Newt is an experimental <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a>
working with other “off the shelf” microservices. It is a proof of
concept of a “new take” on the old web stack.</p>
<p>Newt integrates microservices such as a JSON data source with Pandoc.
This is accomplished by routing the request first to the JSON data
source then sending the results to Pandoc running as a web service. The
the results are then sent back to the requesting web browser or service.
Newt also provides a light weight static file service.</p>
<p>Newt’s configuration can contain a set of “route” definitions. These
map a request to the JSON source via an HTTP call. The route is vetted
(e.g. URL variables and form data are validated) before making the JSON
source request. If the request fails validation Newt responds directly
to the requesting web browser or service via HTTP status codes and
message. If validation succeeds then the JSON source is contacted and
the results (optionally) run through Pandoc via another HTTP call. The
final results are returned to the requesting web browser (or
service).</p>
<p>A typical setup could be Newt, <a
href="https://postgresql.org">Postgres</a> + <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> and <a
href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>. An equally valid setup could be
Solr or Elasticsearch integrating with Pandoc. They key is realizing
there is a JSON data source that can be interacted with via URL and HTTP
method (e.g. GET, POST) and that we can then process the result via
Pandoc running as a web service.</p>
<p>Newt’s scope is limited to decribe a data model, validating the
requests, routing and returning content. It doesn’t know secrets. It
doesn’t persist application state. This allows Newt instance(s) to be
run singularly or in parallel as desired.</p>
<p>Newt runs exclusively as a localhost service. In a production setting
you’d run Newt behind a traditional web server like Apache 2 or NginX.
The front-end web service can provide access control via basic auth or
single sign-on (e.g. Shibboleth). It plays nicely in a container
environment or running straight up as a system service.</p>
<p>Newt is configured via a YAML file. It includes the abilty to pass
through specific environment variables for making requests to a JSON
data source (e.g. credentials).</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>My belief is that many web services used by Archives, Libraries and
Museums can benefit from a simplified and consistent back-end. If the
back-end is “easy” then the limited developer resources can be focused
on the front-end. <strong>An improved front-end offers opportunities to
provide a more humane experience for staff and patrons.</strong>. I
believe it is possible to build a highly useful back-end using off the
shelf services like Postgres+PostgREST, Solr, Elasticsearch, Opensearch
and Pandoc without requiring extensive programming much beyond defining
your database models in SQL and declaring appropriate route maps in a
YAML file.</p>
<p>If an existing application provides a JSON API (e.g. ArchivesSpace,
Invenio-RDM) then it too can be integrated and extended with Newt and
Pandoc. This should facilitate a “development at the edges” approach to
enhancing legacy systems as well as opportunities for creating need
systems to meet the growing needs of Libraries, Archives and
Museums.</p>
<h2 id="taking-advantage-json-sources">Taking advantage JSON
sources</h2>
<p>Newt works with a JSON source that can be accessed via URL and HTTP
methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE). Many systems have JSON
data API today (2023). This includes existing Library, Archive and
Museum applications like Invenio RDM and ArchivesSpace as well as search
engines like Solr and Elasticsearch. It also includes many library
services like CrossRef, DataCite and ORCID. These can be integrated via
Newt in a easily managed may.</p>
<h2 id="newts-approach">Newt’s approach</h2>
<p>From front-end to back-end</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A front end web server (e.g. Apache 2, NginX) can provide access
control where appropriate (e.g. single sign-on via Shibboleth)</p></li>
<li><p>Newt provides static file services but more importantly serves as
a data router. It can validate and map a request to a JSON source, take
those results then send them through Pandoc for transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>JSON data source(s) provide the actual metadata management</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres+PostgREST is an example of a JSON source integrated with a
SQL server</li>
<li>Solr, Elasticsearch or Opensearch can also function as a JSON source
oriented towards search</li>
<li>ArchivesSpace, Invenio RDM are examples of systems that can function
as a JSON sources</li>
<li>CrossRef, DataCite, ORCID are examples of services that function as
JSON sources</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pandoc server provides a templating engine to transform data
sources</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All these can be treated as “off the shelf”. I.e. we’re not writing
them from skratch but we’re accessing them via configuration. Even using
PostgREST with Postgres the “source” boils down to SQL used to define
the data models hosted by the SQL service. Your application is
implemented using SQL and configured with YAML and Pandoc templates.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-newt">Exploring Newt</h2>
<p>Presented are three <a
href="https://github.com/caltechlibrary/newt/tree/main/demos">demos</a>.
The demo code can be rendered using one of three Bash scripts. The bash
scripts will generate all the files needed to run the demo. A “read me”
for each demo describes how to run it.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a

<dd>

3 Demo</a></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The goal of the three demos is to show an evolution towards
simplicity while still enhancing capability.</p>
<h3 id="birds-1-demo-pandoc-only-a-read-only-site">Birds 1 Demo, Pandoc
only, a read only site</h3>
<p>This is a simple static website. It introduces Pandoc. Pandoc is a
good tool to transforming content. In this case Pandoc takes a CSV file
using a Pandoc tempalte to generating a simple “static” website. Static
websites are generally simple to generate and maintain but require
direct access to a host machine to update them.</p>
<ul>
<li>README.md, demo “read me” file</li>
<li>birds.csv, our list of bird sightings</li>
<li>build.sh, a shell script that uses Pandoc to render site</li>
<li>htdocs, the website document directory</li>
<li>page.tmpl, a Pandoc page template using by build.sh</li>
</ul>

<td style="text-align: left;">and rebuilding the site.</td>

<h3 id="birds-2-demo-postgres-postgrest">Birds 2 Demo, Postgres +
PostgREST</h3>
<p>Postgres and PostgREST can be combined to provide a JSON source (aka
JSON API). This allows the website to be “dynamic”. In birds 2 demo
PostgREST runs on localhost and we use another web server to presents
the static files and to proxy to PostgREST. The significant enhancements
over birds 1 demo is our bird list is held in a Postgres database. It
can be dynamically updated via a web browser thanks to PostgREST. The
web browser uses JavaScript to call back to the JSON API. The JSON API
results are rendered in the web browser via JavaScript.</p>
<p>The back-end is written using SQL. PostgREST understands Postgres and
implements the JSON API. The web browser uses JavaScript to contact the
JSON API and assemble pages results. The complexity is shifted out of
the back-end is using an “off the shelf” PostgREST as a microservice.
The back-end boils down to the SQL (50 lines) describing the data model.
Most of the complexity now resides in the front-end (aka web browser
running JavaScript).</p>
<ul>
<li>README.md, demo “read me” file</li>
<li>birds.csv, our prior list of bird sightings to be loaded into SQL
database</li>
<li>htdocs, the website document directory</li>
<li>htdocs/sightings.js, JavaScript support is required in the web
browser make requests, to render the page (60+ lines of code)</li>
<li>postgrest.conf, configuration for PostgREST (3 lines)</li>
<li>setup.sql, SQL setting up data models and JSON data API (50
lines)</li>
</ul>

server.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">You need to know some SQL.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="birds-3-demo-assembling-responses-with-newt">Birds 3 demo,
assembling responses with Newt</h3>
<p>Managing page assembly browser side is a chore. We can skip the
complex JavaScript if we let Newt do the routing of requests to
PostgREST and then sending those results through Pandoc like we did in
our static site demo. With SQL (moding data), YAML (configuring Newt)
and Pandoc templates we can build a web application.</p>
<ul>
<li>README.md, demo “read me” file</li>
<li>birds.yaml, YAML configuration file for Newt (25 lines)</li>
<li>birds.csv, our prior list of bird sightings to be loaded into SQL
database</li>
<li>htdocs, the website document directory</li>
<li>page.tmpl, Pandoc template for listing birds (13 lines)</li>
<li>post_result.tmpl, Pandoc template for POST results (7 lines) from
adding birds</li>
<li>postgrest.conf, configuration for PostgREST</li>
<li>setup.sql, SQL setting up data models and JSON data API (50
lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very similar to both demo 1 and 2. Missing is build.sh from
demo 1. We don’t need it since we’re running Pandoc as a microservice.
There is an YAML configuration file for Newt. Two Pandoc templates
performs a similar duty as the one used in birds 1 demo. Notice there is
no sightings.js in our htdocs directory. From the web browsers point of
view there is no need to run JavaScript to submit a standard web form to
add a bird sighting.</p>
<p>NOTE: Newt provides our static file service so when developing we can
skip Apache 2 or NginX. We would still need a front-end web service if
you want to use it for access control or make the service outside of
“localhost”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the birds 3 I’ve delegated tasks to a series of flexible
microservices.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Postgres</dt>
<dd>
provides data storage and management
</dd>
<dt>PostgREST</dt>
<dd>
Turns a Postgres database into a our JSON data API service
</dd>
<dt>Pandoc</dt>
<dd>
Run in server mode is a powerful template engine, it can convert our
JSON data into a web page
</dd>
<dt>Newt</dt>
<dd>
Is a data router and static file server. It translates the web form
submission into JSON before sending requests to PostgREST. Newt takes
the results and sends that through Pandoc. Newt can also service static
files. It could be used to talk to a JSON oriented full text search
engine like Solr, Elasticsearch or Opensearch. The limit of services it
based only on the number of routes you’re willing to define.
</dd>
<dt>Front-end web server</dt>
<dd>
A front-end web server can provide access control and proxy to any of
our microservices, leverage virtual hosting, etc.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In birds 3, the “coding” of the back-end is reduced to SQL, Pandoc
templates and a YAML file. You are free to make the front-end as simple
or as complex as you like. The microservices and front-end web server
effectively snap together like LEGO bricks.</p>
