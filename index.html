<h1 id="newt-project">Newt Project</h1>
<p>Newt is an experimental set of tools for rapid application
development. Specifically Newt is focused on web based metadata curation
tools. These types of applications are commonly needed in galleries,
libraries, archives and museums (abbr: GLAM). Newt makes creating these
type of applications easier.</p>
<p>How does Newt do that? Newt implements a service oriented
architecture to assemble web applications.</p>
<p>You can think of a web application as a sequence of requests and
responses. In a service oriented architecture we take advantage of that
concept but enhance the model by allowing one web service to make a
request to another. Typically when a web browser contacts your
application one of two things will happen. Your app knows the answer and
hands back the result. With the service oriented architecture your
application has another option. Your application can contact another
service and use that result to answer the request from the web browser.
Newt makes this easy by providing a data router. Unlike setting up a
proxy relationship in Apache or NGINX, Newt provides a pipeline<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Newt’s pipeline is expressed in
YAML. The last service completed hands its result to the Newt Router
which returns the result to the web browser.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Much of the “back end” of a web application is
already available as off the shelf software. Here is a short list of
examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a> and <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> provides a JSON API for data
management</li>
<li>MySQL and MySQL REST Service can provide a JSON API for data
management</li>
<li><a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a>, Elasticsearch,
OpenSearch can provide full text search as a JSON web service</li>
<li><a href="https://archivesspace.org">ArchivesSpace</a> provides a
JSON API web service</li>
<li><a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/">Invenio RDM</a> provides
a JSON API web service</li>
<li><a href="https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/">Cantaloupe IIIF
Image server</a> an IIIF <a
href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/">API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list. These types of applications can all
be integrated into your application through configuring the connection
in Newt’s YAML file. Newt Router runs the data pipelines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait, what about my custom metadata needs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That role can be filled by a JSON data source. In the second Newt
prototype our focus is on using Postgres+PostgREST as that JSON data
source. Newt’s code generator lends a hand here. Using Newt’s YAML file
the code generator can generate SQL for setting up Postgres+PostgREST,
the SQL for managing your objects and the configuration file for
PostgREST. Additionally Newt’s code generator can render Mustache
templates too. Between the SQL and Mustache templates you have the basic
CRUD-L<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> operations covered. Off the self
software with the Newt generator, router and template service provides
the core features for building many GLAM applications.</p>
<h2 id="does-newt-clean-my-house-or-make-cocktails">Does Newt clean my
house or make cocktails?</h2>
<p>Newt is a narrowly focused rapid application development toolbox.
Newt will not clean your house or make a cocktail. Additionally it does
not support the class of web applications that handle file uploads. That
means it is not a replacement for Drupal, WordPress, Islandora, etc.
Newt is for building applications more in line with ArchivesSpace but
with simpler data models. If you need file upload support Newt is not
the right solution at this time.</p>
<p>Newt applications are well suited to interacting with other
applications that provide a JSON API. A service with a JSON API can be
treated as a JSON data source. A JSON data source can easily be run
through a pipeline. Many GLAM applications like ArchivesSpace and
Invenio RDM provide JSON API. It is possible to extended those systems
by creating simpler services that can talk to those JSON data sources.
Newt is well suited to this “development at the edges” approach.</p>
<p>What if those systems aren’t available on localhost? In that case you
need to provide a proxy from these services to localhost (e.g. via
Apache 2, NGINX or Python script). You would write your Newt YAML file
pointing at the localhost end point. This approach can be used to
integrated external systems like ORCID, ROR, CrossRef, DataCite, Open
Alex, Pub Med Central.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-newt-impact-web-application-development">How does Newt
impact web application development?</h2>
<p>A Newt application encourages the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>preference for “off the shelf” over writing new code</li>
<li>modeling your data simply</li>
<li>use a database management system for managing your data</li>
<li>prefer software that can function as a JSON data source</li>
<li>transforming data representations (if needed) by using a light
weight template engine</li>
<li>code generation where appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="if-newt-doesnt-make-cocktails-what-is-it-bringing-to-the-party">If
Newt doesn’t make cocktails, what is it bringing to the party?</h2>
<p>In 2024 there is allot of off the self software to build on. Newt
provides a few tools to fill in the gaps.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>newtrouter</code> is a stateless web service (a.k.a. micro
service) that routes a web request through a data pipeline built from
other web services</li>
<li><code>newtgenerator</code> is a code generator that understands the
data models described in Newt’s YAML configuration file. Newt can
generate code to setup and model data in Postgres, configure PostgREST
and generate Mustache templates to take the PostgREST output and turn it
into a web page.</li>
<li><code>newtmustache</code> is a simple stateless template engine
inspired by Pandoc server that supports the Mustache template language
and is designed to process data from a JSON data source.</li>
</ul>
<p>Newt’s 2nd prototype is being tested building applications based
on</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a>, data management</li>
<li><a href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a>, a service that turns
Postgres into a JSON API</li>
</ul>
<p>The Newt YAML ties this together expressing</p>
<ul>
<li>applications (run time information for Newt Router and Newt
Mustache)</li>
<li>models (descriptions of data as you would provided in a web
form)</li>
<li>routes (web requests differentiated by a HTTP method and URL path
that trigger processing in a data pipeline)</li>
<li>templates (pairs a request with a template to transform a JSON into
some other format such as an HTML document)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-type-of-applications-are-supported-by-newt">What type of
applications are supported by Newt?</h2>
<p>Most GLAM applications are focused on managing and curating some sort
of metadata records. This is the primary target of Newt. This might be
as simple as a controlled vocabulary or as complex as an archival or
repository metadata record.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Over the last several decades web applications became very complex.
This complexity is expensive in terms of reliability, enhancement, bug
fixes and software sustainability. Newt address this by reducing the
code you write and focusing your efforts on declaring what you want.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A brief historic detour to set context</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Databases have been used to generate web pages since the early web.
Databases are well suited to managing data. When the web became dynamic,
databases continued to be use for data persistence. By 1993 the web as
an application platform was born<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and with it a good
platform for providing useful organizational and institutional
software.</p>
<p>By the mid 1990s the Open Source databases like MySQL and Postgres
were popular choices for building web applications. It is important to
note neither MySQL or Postgres spoke HTTP<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. To
solve this problem many people wrote software in languages like Perl,
PHP and Python that ran inside the popular Apache web server. It was a
pain to setup but once setup relatively easy to build things that relied
on databases. This led the web to explode with bespoke systems. By the
late 1990s and early 2000s practice of “mashing up” sites (i.e. content
reuse) was the rage. Bespoke systems took advantage of content reuse
too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes">Yahoo
Pipes</a> was a very interesting expression of the “mashup culture”<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Yahoo Pipes inspired Newt’s data
pipelines. Eventual the bespoke systems gave way to common use cases<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. A good example of a common use case
is Apache’s <a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a> search engine.
Another example is how bespoke content management systems gave way to <a
href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a> and <a
href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fast forward to 2024, context set</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the back end of web applications can largely be assemble from
off the shelf software. Middleware however remains complex. I believe
this to be a by product of inertia in software development practices and
the assumption that what is good for “Google Scale” is good for
everyone.</p>
<p>I think a radical simplification is due. <strong>Newt is intended to
spark that conversation</strong>. My observation is most software
doesn’t need to scale large. Even in the research and GLAM communities
we don’t routinely write software that scales as large as <a
href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>. We don’t typically support tens
of thousands of simultaneous users. If you accept that premise then we
can focus our efforts around orchestrating off the shelf components and
put our remaining development efforts into improving the human
experience of using our software. A better human experience is an
intended side effect of Newt.</p>
<p>A big key to simplification is narrowing the focus of our middleware.
When our middleware has to implement everything it becomes very complex.
Look at Drupal and WordPress. They implement data modeling, data
management, user accounts, access management, data transformation.</p>
<p>I think our web services should be doing less, much less. Our web
services should be narrowly focused. Conceptually simpler. Do one or two
things really well. Newt enables using simpler discrete services to
build our applications.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-off-the-shelf-deliverables">Working with off the
shelf deliverables</h2>
<p>Take the following as a “for instance”.</p>
<ul>
<li>(data management) Postgres combined with PostgREST gives you an out
of the box JSON API for managing data</li>
<li>(full text search) Solr gives you a powerful, friendly, JSON API for
search and discovery</li>
<li>(access control) Apache 2 or NGINX combined with Shibboleth for
access control and communicating with the web browser</li>
<li>(rich client) Web browsers now provide a rich software platform in
their own right</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above list we can build capable applications relying on the
sophisticated features of our web browsers. This is true even without
using Newt. There is a problem though. If we only use the above software
to build our application we must rely on JavaScript (or WASM module)
running in the web browser to interact with the server. This sounds
simpler. In practice this is a terrible idea<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What we should do is use Newt to tie those JSON services together and
send rendered HTML back to the web browser. Newt Router provides static
file service and a means of pipelining our JSON data source through a
template engine. Newt Mustache provides a template engine. Newt provides
the missing bits from my original list so we don’t need to send
JavaScript down the wire to the web browser. The Newt approach uses less
bandwidth, fewer network accesses and less computations cycles on your
viewing device. The Newt approach takes advantage of what the web
browser is really good at without turning your web pages into a web
service. Newt YAML describes the system you want. You get the Newt
capabilities without writing much code. Maybe without writing any code
if Newt’s code generator does a sufficient job for your needs.</p>
<h3 id="a-newt-baseline">A Newt baseline</h3>
<p>Web services talk to other web services all the time. This isn’t new.
It isn’t exotic. Newt scales down this approach to the single
application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we align access control with our front end web server?</li>
<li>Can we insist on our database management system providing a JSON
API?</li>
<li>Can we treat the output of one web service as the input for the
next?</li>
<li>Can we aggregate these into data pipelines?</li>
<li>Will that be enough to define our web application?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Spring 2024 for metadata curation apps I think the answer is “yes
we can”.</p>
