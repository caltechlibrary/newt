<h1 id="newt-a-new-take-of-the-web-stack">Newt, a new take of the web
stack</h1>
<p>Newt is short for “new take”. Specific it is my new take on building
web applications from a few off the shelf microservices. The
microservices newt explores are <a
href="https://postgresql.org">Postgres</a>, <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a>, <a
href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc server</a>, Newt a minimalist URL
request router.</p>
<p>My belief is that many web services used by Archives, Libraries and
Museums can benefit from a simplier back-end. If the back-end is “easy”
then the limited developer resources can be focused on the front end
creating a better user experiences for staff and patrons.</p>
<p>The Newt’s vision is the back-end can be defined simply through data
models in a SQL database like Postgres. The models can be exposed as a
microservice using PostgREST via via SQL queries, views, functions and
procedure that PostgREST can expose as a JSON API. If you need some sort
of server side template engine for content provided by PostgREST then
Pandoc server is available and sorts many different types of content
transformation as well as a template engine. Finally venerable static
files can be served by either your front end web server or a minimalist
URL router like that implemetned at part of Newt.</p>
<p>I feel if you know SQL, HTML, and perhaps CSS that should be enough
to build useful web applications and services without having to know
languages like Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Go or Java. While I will discuss
using browser side JavaScript in the initial exploration of the micro
serverice mention above by the time we get to the final demo which
features the Newt URL router you’ll need to use SQL, HTML and some CSS
and you’ll have a web application that works equally well in modern
browers like Firefox, Safari and Chrome as well as with text mode
browsers like Lynx.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-postgres-and-postgrest">Introducing Postgres and
PostgREST</h2>
<p>To understand the Newt it is first helpful to understand Postgres and
PostgREST. The first demo, <a href="birds/">birds</a>, builds a simple
bird spotting web site. It uses PostgREST as a JSON data API and front
end web server (specifically <code>python3 -m http http.server</code>)
to present static web pages that interact with the PostgREST service.
The purpose of the demo is to show how to develop using Postgres 15 and
PostgREST 11 and static files.</p>

<h2
id="introducing-pandoc-server-a-powerful-template-engine">Introducing
Pandoc server, a powerful template engine</h2>
<p>The second demo, <a href="bees/">bees</a>, builds on the birds demo
by adding Pandoc server as a template engine for rendering content
retrieved from Postgres via PostgREST. Pandoc service provide much of
the same capability of the Pandoc command line program does. It is
simple and safe to run as a localhost web service. In bees I am
presenting a bee spotting application with reports rendered via data
from PostgREST and processed by Pandoc server.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-newt-a-minimalist-url-router">Introducing Newt, a
minimalist URL router</h2>
<p>There are times when relying on JavaScript in the web browser to
assemble a web page is not appropriate or just too much work. Newt URL
router was developed to eleminate assembling the content provided by
Postgres, PostgREST and Pandoc server. Newt URL router takes care of
mapping a public facing URL path to PostgREST and can optional send the
content from PostgREST through Pandoc via Pandoc server.</p>
<p>Newt URL router just needs to know where to contact PostgREST and
Pandoc server and optional if you have a directory of static content you
wish to expose too. Newt reads a table (e.g. a CSV file) to get the
description of the routes, the transforms needed to query PostgREST and
any template or Pandoc options desired if you want to run the retrieved
content through Pandoc server. Newt takes care of coordinating the other
microservices return content directly back to the web browser (in the
developer setting) or to a front-end web server like Apache2 or NginX
(e.g. in a production setting).</p>

<li><a href="setup-flowers.bash">setup-flowers.bash</a>, a bash script

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In this final demo, now including the Newt URL router, we use SQL to
define our back-end service, Pandoc (via Pandoc server) to format our
dynamic web poages and static files to complete our website
implementation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In all our demos we’ve devided the tasks through a series of flexible
microservices can can be used individually or in combination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres, data storage, back-end configuration and data
services</li>
<li>PostgREST, a JSON data API</li>
<li>Pandoc server as a template engine</li>
<li>Newt a URL router for PostgREST, Pandoc server and static files</li>
<li>(in production setting) a front end web server providing access
control and user authentication (e.g. Apache2, NginX)</li>
</ul>
<p>The “coding” left to someone developing a website or service can be
as minimal as knowning some SQL, HTML and Pandoc.</p>
