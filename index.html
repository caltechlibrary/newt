<h1 id="newt-project">Newt Project</h1>
<p>Newt is an experimental set of tools for rapid application
development. Specifically Newt is focused on web based metadata curation
tools. These types of applications are commonly needed in galleries,
libraries, archives and museums (abbr: GLAM). Newt makes creating these
type of applications easier.</p>
<p>How does Newt do that? Newt generates applications implementing a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service
oriented architecture</a>.</p>
<p>You can think of a web application as a sequence of requests and
responses. Typically when a web browser contacts your web application
one of two things will happen. Your app knows the answer and hands back
the result. With the service oriented architecture your application has
another option. Your application can contact another service and use
that result to answer the request from the web browser. Newt’s
enhancement to a basic service oriented architecture is to provide an
easy means to construct data processing pipelines<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>With data pipelines we can accept a request and feed that request to
one service then take its output and send it to the next service. Newt
does this by providing a data router. Newt can manage the request
sequence through a simple YAML described pipeline. While it is possible
to create pipelines using Apache and NginX proxy features in practice
that approach quickly becomes an unmanageable configuration problem. You
could encapsulate clusters of processes in containers but this too
becomes complex to manage. Newt’s router can cut through the hairball of
configurations and define pipelines per request route. With a Newt
pipeline the last service completed hands its result to the Newt’s
router which returns the result to the web browser.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Much of the “back end” of a web application is
already available as off the shelf software. Here is a short list of
examples used by Caltech Library.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a> and <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> provides a JSON API for data
management</li>
<li><a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a> and Elasticsearch,
OpenSearch can provide full text search as a JSON web service</li>
<li><a href="https://archivesspace.org">ArchivesSpace</a> provides a
JSON API web service</li>
<li><a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/">Invenio RDM</a> provides
a JSON API web service</li>
<li><a href="https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/">Cantaloupe IIIF
Image server</a> an IIIF <a
href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/">API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list. These types of applications can all
be integrated into your application through configuring the connection
in Newt’s YAML file. Newt’s router runs the data pipelines and can host
static content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait, what about my custom metadata needs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That role can be filled by services that provide a JSON data source.
In the second Newt prototype our focus is on using Postgres+PostgREST as
a JSON data source. Newt’s code generation lends a hand here. Using
Newt’s YAML file the code generator can generate SQL and configuration
for setting up Postgres+PostgREST. Newt’s code generator can also render
Mustache templates. These can transform JSON data into a web page.
Between the generated configuration, SQL, templates, Newt’s router,
Newt’ template engine and Postgres+PostgREST you have service oriented
application providing basic CRUD-L<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> operations. This is
nicely suited for metadata management applications. You can enhance your
application further through customizing the generated SQL and templates
or through leveraging JavaScript and static content. Of course other
JSON data sources maybe leverage in a data pipeline (e.g. Solr,
ElasticSearch, OpenSearch).</p>
<h2 id="does-newt-clean-my-house-or-make-cocktails">Does Newt clean my
house or make cocktails?</h2>
<p>Newt is a narrowly focused rapid application development toolbox.
Newt will not clean your house or make a cocktail. Additionally it does
not support the class of web applications that handle file uploads. That
means it is not a replacement for Drupal, WordPress, Islandora, etc.
Newt is for building applications more in line with ArchivesSpace but
with simpler data models. If you need file upload support Newt is not
the right solution at this time.</p>
<p>Newt applications are well suited to interacting with other
applications that provide a JSON API. A service with a JSON API can be
treated as a JSON data source. A JSON data source can easily be run
through a pipeline. Many GLAM applications like ArchivesSpace and
Invenio RDM provide JSON API. It is possible to extended those systems
by creating simpler services that can talk to those JSON data sources.
Newt is well suited to this “development at the edges” approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if those systems aren’t available on localhost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Services not available on localhost must be proxied to integrate with
your Newt application. Why is this necessary? Short answer, security.
Newt seeks to reduce the attack surface of your web application as much
as possible. It does that by only trusting services offered directly on
localhost. Newt’s application models presumes you’re running behind a
“front end web server” like Apache 2, NginX or Lighttd. These systems
can be configured to provide access control as well as perform proxy
services. The front end web server is your first line of defense against
a cracker.</p>
<p>External web services integrate through a proxy setup (e.g ORCID,
ROR, CrossRef or DataCite). This can be done via the front end web
server or by writing a dedicated problem. Most of the popular web
programming languages (e.g. Python, PHP, Go, TypeScript/JavaScript on
Deno) provide libraries or packages that may this straight forward.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-newt-impact-web-application-development">How does Newt
impact web application development?</h2>
<p>A Newt application encourages the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>preference for “off the shelf” over writing new code</li>
<li>modeling your data simply</li>
<li>use a database management system for managing your data and SQL
functions to enforce data validation</li>
<li>prefer software that can function as a JSON data source</li>
<li>transforming data representations (if needed) by using a light
weight template engine</li>
<li>code generation where appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="if-newt-doesnt-make-cocktails-what-is-it-bringing-to-the-party">If
Newt doesn’t make cocktails, what is it bringing to the party?</h2>
<p>In 2024 there is allot of off the self software to build on. Newt
provides a few tools to fill in the gaps.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>newt</code> is a development tool for data modeling,
generating code, running Newt router, mustache template engine and
PostgREST</li>
<li>stand alone services for when you’re ready to deploy your
application
<ul>
<li><code>newtrouter</code> is a stateless web service (a.k.a. micro
service) that routes a web requests through a data pipelines built from
other web services</li>
<li><code>newtmustache</code> is a stateless template engine inspired by
Pandoc server that supports the Mustache template language and is
designed to process data from a JSON data source</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Newt’s 2nd prototype is being tested building applications based
on</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a>, data management</li>
<li><a href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a>, a service that turns
Postgres into a JSON API</li>
</ul>
<p>The Newt YAML ties this together expressing</p>
<ul>
<li>applications (run time information for Newt’s router, Newt’s
template engine and PostgREST)</li>
<li>models (descriptions of data as you would provided in a web
form)</li>
<li>routes (web requests differentiated by a HTTP method and URL path
that trigger processing in a data pipeline)</li>
<li>templates (pairs a request with a template to transform a JSON into
some other format such as an HTML document)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-type-of-applications-are-supported-by-newt">What type of
applications are supported by Newt?</h2>
<p>Most GLAM applications are focused on managing and curating some sort
of metadata records. Sometimes these metadata records are quite complex
(e.g. ArchivesSpace, RDM records) but often they are simple (e.g. a list
of authors, a list of citations). Newt’s primary target is generating
applications to manage simple data models. Simple data models are those
which can be expressed in web forms via HTML5 native input elements.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Over the last several decades web applications became very complex.
This complexity is expensive in terms of reliability, enhancement, bug
fixes and software sustainability. Newt address this by reducing the
code you write and focusing your efforts on declaring what you want.</p>
<p>In 2024 the back end of web applications can largely be assemble from
off the shelf software. Middleware however remains complex. I believe
this to be a by product of inertia in software development practices and
the assumption that what is good for “Google Scale” is good for
everyone.</p>
<p>I think a radical simplification is due. <strong>Newt is intended to
spark that conversation</strong>. My observation is most software
doesn’t need to scale large. Even in the research and GLAM communities
we don’t routinely write software that scales as large as <a
href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>. We don’t typically support tens
of thousands of simultaneous users. I think we can focus our efforts
around orchestrating off the shelf components and put our remaining
development efforts into improving the human experience of using our
software. A better human experience is an intended side effect of
Newt.</p>
<p>A big key to simplification is narrowing the focus of our middleware.
When our middleware has to implement everything it becomes very complex.
Look at Drupal and WordPress. They implement data modeling, data
management, user accounts, access management, data transformation.</p>
<p>I think our web services should be doing less, much less. Our web
services should be narrowly focused. Conceptually simpler. Do one or two
things really well. Newt enables using simpler discrete services to
build our applications.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-off-the-shelf-deliverables">Working with off the
shelf deliverables</h2>
<p>Take the following as a “for instance”.</p>
<ul>
<li>(data management) Postgres combined with PostgREST gives you an out
of the box JSON API for managing data</li>
<li>(full text search) Solr gives you a powerful, friendly, JSON API for
search and discovery</li>
<li>(access control) Apache 2 or NGINX combined with Shibboleth for
access control and communicating with the web browser</li>
<li>(rich client) Web browsers now provide a rich software platform in
their own right</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above list we can build capable applications relying on the
sophisticated features of our web browsers. This is true even without
using Newt. There is a problem though. If we only use the above software
to build our application we must rely on JavaScript (or WASM module)
running in the web browser to interact with the server. This sounds
simple. In practice this is a terrible idea<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What we should do is use Newt to tie those JSON services together and
send rendered HTML back to the web browser. Newt’s router provides
static file service and a means of pipelining our JSON data source
through a template engine. Newt provides a Mustache template engine for
that purpose. Newt provides the missing bits from my original list so we
don’t need to send JavaScript down the wire to the web browser. The Newt
approach uses less bandwidth, fewer network accesses and less
computations cycles on your viewing device. The Newt approach takes
advantage of what the web browser is really good at without turning your
web pages into a web service. Newt YAML describes the system you want.
You get the Newt capabilities without writing much code. Maybe without
writing any code if Newt’s code generator does a sufficient job for your
needs.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-baseline">A new baseline</h3>
<p>Web services talk to other web services all the time. This isn’t new.
It isn’t exotic. Newt scales down this approach to the single
application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we align access control with our front end web server?</li>
<li>Can we insist on our database management system providing a JSON
API?</li>
<li>Can we treat the output of one web service as the input for the
next?</li>
<li>Can we aggregate these into data pipelines?</li>
<li>Will that be enough to define our web application?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Spring 2024 for metadata curation apps I think the answer is “yes
we can”.</p>
<h2 id="what-comes-with-the-newt-project">What comes with the Newt
Project?</h2>
<p>The primary tools are.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="newt.1.html">newt</a> a developer tool for building a Newt
