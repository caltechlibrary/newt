<h1 id="newt-project">Newt Project</h1>
<p>Newt is an experimental rapid application development. Specifically
Newt is focused on creating web based metadata curation tools. These
types of applications are commonly needed in galleries, libraries,
archives and museums (abbr: GLAM). Newt makes creating these type of
applications easier.</p>
<p>How does Newt do that? Newt generates an application by implementing
a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">service
oriented architecture</a> using a combination of off the shelf software
and generated code.</p>
<p>You can think of a web application as a sequence of requests and
responses. Traditionally a web browser contacts your web site or
application then one of two things will happen. Your app knows the
answer and hands back the result. Alternatively if it doesn’t know the
answer it tells you it can’t do so (e.g. 404 HTTP STATUS CODE). With
service oriented architecture your application has another option. Your
application can contact another service and use that result to answer
the request from the web browser. Newt’s implements a service oriented
architecture by orchestrating data processing pipelines<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>With data pipelines we can accept a request and feed that request to
one service then take its output and send it to the next service. Newt
does this by providing a data router. Newt can manage the request
sequence through a simple YAML described pipeline. While it is possible
to create pipelines using Apache and NginX proxy features in practice
that approach quickly becomes an unmanageable configuration problem. You
could encapsulate clusters of processes in containers but this too
becomes complex to manage. Newt’s router can cut through the hairball of
configurations and define pipelines per request route. With Newt’s
pipelines the last service completed hands its result back to Newt’s
router which returns the result to the web browser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data pipelines are defined in Newt’ YAML configuration file. The
pipelines are managed by Newt’s data router.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this important? Much of the “back end” of a web application is
already available as off the shelf software. Here is a short list of
examples used by Caltech Library.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a> and <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> provides a JSON API for data
management</li>
<li><a href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset">Dataset</a>, a
simple JSON document store that has an out of the box JSON API provided
by <a
href="https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset/datasetd.1.html">datasetd</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a> and Elasticsearch,
OpenSearch can provide full text search as a JSON web service</li>
<li><a href="https://archivesspace.org">ArchivesSpace</a> provides a
JSON API web service</li>
<li><a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/">Invenio RDM</a> provides
a JSON API web service</li>
<li><a href="https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/">Cantaloupe IIIF
Image server</a> an IIIF <a
href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/">API</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is not an exhaustive list</strong>. These types of
applications can all be integrated into your application through
configuring the connection in Newt’s YAML file. Newt’s router runs the
data pipelines and can host static content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait, what about my custom metadata needs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metadata oriented applications tend to all need CRUD-L<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
features. Customization tend towards data models. Newt’s configuration
file includes simple YAML description of your data models. It uses the
data model to render configuration, middleware and templates. Newt’s
data router ties them all together into an application using service
oriented architecture.</p>
<p>Newt provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a simple data modeler</li>
<li>code generation</li>
<li>template engine</li>
<li>data routing</li>
</ul>
<p>Extending your basic create, retrieve, update, delete and list
application (abbr: CRUD-L) can be done through integrating additional
data routes and services or through customizing the generated code.</p>
<h2 id="does-newt-clean-my-house-or-make-cocktails">Does Newt clean my
house or make cocktails?</h2>
<p>Newt is a narrowly focused rapid application development toolbox.
Newt will not clean your house or make a cocktail. Additionally it does
not support the class of web applications that handle file uploads. That
means it is not a replacement for Drupal, WordPress, Islandora, etc.
Newt is for building applications more in line with ArchivesSpace but
with simpler data models. If you need file upload support Newt is not
the right solution at this time.</p>
<p>Newt applications are well suited to interacting with other
applications that provide a JSON API. A service with a JSON API can be
treated as a JSON data source. A JSON data source can easily be run
through a pipeline. Many GLAM applications like ArchivesSpace and
Invenio RDM provide JSON API. It is possible to extended those systems
by creating simpler services that can talk to those JSON data sources.
Newt is well suited to this “development at the edges” approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if those systems aren’t available on localhost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Services not available on localhost must be proxied to integrate with
your Newt application. Why is this necessary? Short answer, security.
Newt seeks to reduce the attack surface of your web application as much
as possible. It does that by only trusting services offered directly on
localhost. Newt’s application models presumes you’re running behind a
“front end web server” like Apache 2, NginX or Lighttd. These systems
can be configured to provide access control as well as perform proxy
services. The front end web server is your first line of defense against
a cracker.</p>
<p>External web services integrate through a proxy setup (e.g ORCID,
ROR, CrossRef or DataCite). This can be done via the front end web
server or by writing a dedicated proxy service. Today writing proxy
services us easily accomplished in most popular programming languages
due to good support for web protocols. This is true of Python, PHP,
JavaScript, Go, Rust and many others.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-newt-impact-web-application-development">How does Newt
impact web application development?</h2>
<p>A Newt application encourages the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>modeling your data simply the result is expressed in YAML</li>
<li>preference for “off the shelf” over writing new code</li>
<li>use a database management system for managing your data and SQL
functions</li>
<li>prefer software that can function as a JSON data source</li>
<li>transforming data representations by using a light weight template
engine</li>
<li>code generation where appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="if-newt-doesnt-make-cocktails-what-is-it-bringing-to-the-party">If
Newt doesn’t make cocktails, what is it bringing to the party?</h2>
<p>In 2024 there is allot of off the self software to build on. Newt
provides a few tools to fill in the gaps.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>newt</code> is a development tool for data modeling,
generating code, running Newt router, template engine and PostgREST or
dataset collections</li>
<li><code>ndr</code> is a stateless web service (a.k.a. micro service)
that routes a web requests through a data pipelines built from other web
services</li>
<li><code>nte</code> is a stateless template engine inspired by Pandoc
server that supports the <a
href="https://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebarsjs</a> template language and
is designed to process data from a JSON data source</li>
</ul>
<p>The Newt YAML configuration ties these together expressing</p>
<ul>
<li>data modeling (descriptions of data as you would provided in a web
form)</li>
<li>code generation</li>
<li>data routes (web requests differentiated by a HTTP method and URL
path that trigger processing in a data pipeline)</li>
<li>template maps (path/template pairs used that can recieve JSON and
render a results)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-type-of-applications-are-supported-by-newt">What type of
applications are supported by Newt?</h2>
<p>Most GLAM applications are focused on managing and curating some sort
of metadata records. Sometimes these metadata records are quite complex
(e.g. ArchivesSpace, RDM records) but often they are simple (e.g. a list
of authors, a list of citations). Newt’s primary target is generating
applications to manage simple data models. Simple data models are those
which can be expressed in web forms via HTML5 native input elements.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Over the last several decades web applications became very complex.
This complexity is expensive in terms of reliability, enhancement, bug
fixes and software sustainability. Newt is an attempt to address this by
reducing the code you write and focusing your efforts on declaring what
you want.</p>
<p>In 2024 the back end of web applications can largely be assemble from
off the shelf software. Middleware however remains complex. I believe
this to be a by product of inertia in software development practices and
the assumption that what is good for “Google Scale” is good for
everyone.</p>
<p>I think a radical simplification is due. <strong>Newt is intended to
spark that conversation</strong>. My observation is most software
doesn’t need to scale large. In the research and GLAM communities we
don’t routinely write software that scales as large as <a
href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>. We don’t typically support tens
of thousands of simultaneous users. I think we can focus our efforts
around orchestrating off the shelf components and put our remaining
development time into improving the human experience using our software.
A better human experience is an intended side effect of Newt.</p>
<p>A big key to simplification is narrowing the focus of our middleware.
When our middleware has to implement everything it becomes very complex.
Look at Drupal and WordPress. They implement data modeling, data
management, user accounts, access management, data transformation.</p>
<p>I think our web services should be doing less, much less. Our web
services should be narrowly focused. Conceptually simpler. Do one or two
things really well. Newt enables using simpler discrete services to
build our applications.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-off-the-shelf-deliverables">Working with off the
shelf deliverables</h2>
<p>Take the following as a “for instance”.</p>
<ul>
<li>(data management) Postgres combined with PostgREST gives you an out
of the box JSON API for managing data</li>
<li>(access control) Apache 2 or NGINX combined with Shibboleth for
access control and communicating with the web browser</li>
<li>(rich client) Web browsers now provide a rich software platform in
their own right</li>
<li>(optionally you can full text search) Solr gives you a powerful,
friendly, JSON API for search and discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above list we can build capable applications relying on the
sophisticated features of our web browsers. This is true even without
using Newt. There is a problem though. If we only use the above software
to build our application we must rely on JavaScript (or WASM module)
running in the web browser to interact with the server. This sounds
simple. In practice this is a terrible idea<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What we should do is use Newt to tie those JSON services together and
send rendered HTML back to the web browser. Newt’s router provides
static file service and a means of pipelining our JSON data source
through a template engine. Newt provides a Handlebars<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
template engine for that purpose. Newt provides the missing bits from my
original list so we don’t need to send JavaScript down the wire to the
web browser. The Newt approach uses less bandwidth, fewer network
accesses and less computations cycles on your viewing device. The Newt
approach takes advantage of what the web browser is really good at
without turning your web pages into a web service. Newt YAML describes
the system you want. You get the Newt capabilities without writing much
code. Maybe without writing any code if Newt’s code generator does a
sufficient job for your needs.</p>
<p>Web services talk to other web services all the time. This isn’t new.
It isn’t exotic. Newt scales down this approach to the single
application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we align access control with our front end web server?</li>
<li>Can we insist on our database management system providing a JSON
API?</li>
<li>Can we treat the output of one web service as the input for the
next?</li>
<li>Can we aggregate these into data pipelines?</li>
<li>Will that be enough to define our web application?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Spring 2024 for metadata curation apps I think the answer is “yes
we can”.</p>
<h2 id="what-comes-with-the-newt-project">What comes with the Newt
