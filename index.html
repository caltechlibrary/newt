<h1 id="newt">Newt</h1>
<p>Newt is an experimental <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a>
working with other “off the shelf” microservices. It is a proof of
concept of a “new take” on the old web stack. The “new stack” is built
on off the shelf microservices. The initial targets are
Postgres+PostgREST and Pandoc server. In practice the Postgres+PostgREST
can be replaced (or operating along side) any JSON data source
(e.g. Solr, Opensearch) available via localhost.</p>
<h2 id="typical-newt-stack">Typical newt stack</h2>
<ul>
<li>Newt is a data router, form validator, static file microservice</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> server provides a template
engine to render JSON as something else</li>
<li>JSON data sources
<ul>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a> + <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a>, SQL to JSON API</li>
<li>Solr, Elasticsearch/Opensearch full text search engines</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Newt prototype type runs on localhost and assumes all the JSON
data sources also run on localhost. In the future support for JSON data
sources requiring https protocol support may be added (e.g. JSON data
sources like CrossRef, DataCite, ORCID use https protocol).</p>
<p>In a production setting you would normally run Newt behind a
front-end web server like Apache 2 or NginX. The advantage of this
approach is that the front-end web service can provide https protocol
support, authentication, and single sign-on integration. Newt just
provides JSON data routing, form validation and limited static file
service support.</p>
<p>Newt as an “off the shelf” microservice plays nicely with virtual
hosting and containers. You have lots of flexibility to deploy from a
single machines to the data center and the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="orchestrating-your-app-with-newt">Orchestrating your app with
Newt</h2>
<p>Newt is configured with a YAML file. Currently the configuration file
uses three main attributes</p>
<dl>
<dt>htdocs</dt>
<dd>
The path to the htdocs directory holding any static assets (e.g. CSS,
JavaScript, HTML files, image assets)
</dd>
<dt>env</dt>
<dd>
A list of environment variables available to Newt’s routes and models
</dd>
<dt>routes</dt>
<dd>
An object describing the mapping of an HTTP request to JSON data source
and and optional Pandoc server processing
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A routes includes the following attributes</p>
<dl>
<dt>var</dt>
<dd>
(optional) A list of variable names and types used in validating a
request path or web from submission
</dd>
<dt>req_path</dt>
<dd>
A expression describing a URL path received by Newt (typical made by a
web browser or proxy for the web browser)
</dd>
<dt>req_method</dt>
<dd>
An HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) related to the
req_path being handled
</dd>
<dt>api_url</dt>
<dd>
The URL expression used by Newt to contact the JSON data source for the
route described by req_path and req_method
</dd>
<dt>api_method</dt>
<dd>
The HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) of the JSON data
source associated api_url for the given route
</dd>
<dt>api_content_type</dt>
<dd>
The HTTP content type expression used when submitting the request to the
JSON data source
</dd>
<dt>pandoc_template</dt>
<dd>
(optional) The path to the pandoc template used to process the results
of the JSON data source request results
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additional attributes maybe added to the YAML file in the future.</p>
<h2 id="data-flow-in-steps">Data flow in steps</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Web browser =&gt; Newt</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; JSON data source</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; Pandoc</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; Web browser</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pandoc processing is optional. In this way you could expose
selected elements of your JSON data source to the front-end web service
by mapping the api request but skipping the Pandoc template used to
transform the data.</p>
<h3 id="handling-errors">Handling errors</h3>
<p>Newt vets the initial request before contacting the JSON data source.
If the request has a problem it will return an appropriate HTTP status
code and message. If the request to the JSON data source has a problem,
it will pass through the HTTP status code and message provided by the
JSON data source. Likewise if Pandoc server has a problem Newt will
forward that HTTP status code and message. If either the JSON data
source or Pandoc server is unavailable Newt will return a “Gateway” http
status code and message.</p>
<h3 id="static-file-support">Static file support</h3>
<p>Newt first checks if a request is matched in one of the defined
routes. If not it’ll try to service the content from the “htdocs”
location. If the file is not found then a 404 is returned. If the
“htdocs” value is not set then a 404 will get returned if no routes
match.</p>
<p>Note Newt’s static file services are very basic. You can’t configure
mime type responses or modify behavior via “htaccess” files. If Newt is
running behind a traditional web server like Apache 2 or NginX then you
should use that service to host your static content as it will give you
much more control.</p>
<h3 id="handling-secrets-scaling-and-limitations">Handling secrets,
scaling and limitations</h3>
<p>Newt’s YAML file does not explicitly contain any secrets. This was
intentional. You may need to pass sensitive data to your JSON data
source for access (e.g. credentials like a username and password). This
should be provided via the environment and the YAML file needs to
include these environment variable names in the “env” attribute. The
environment variables can be used to contact the JSON data source. There
is still a risk in that theoretically that data source could echo return
sensitive information. Newt can’t prevent that. Newt is naive in its
knowledge of the JSON data source content it receives and hands of to
Pandoc. You’re responsible for securing sensitive information at the
database JSON data source level.</p>
<p>While Newt was conceived as a small scale web application platform
for Libraries, Archives and Museums it is capable of scaling big as long
as your JSON data source can scale big. Using the Newt stack elements
can all be run easily behind load balancers and in parallel across
machines because they require no synchronized shared of data between
them or instances of them. Postgres itself can be configured in a HA
cluster to support high availability and high demand.</p>
<p>Presently Newt does not support file uploads. If you need that you’ll
need to write your own service to handle it.</p>
<p>Newt runs exclusively as a localhost service. In a production setting
you’d run Newt behind a traditional web server like Apache 2 or NginX.
The front-end web service can provide access control via basic auth or
single sign-on (e.g. Shibboleth). Newt plays nicely in a container
environment, running as a system service or invoked from the command
line.</p>
<h2 id="taking-advantage-of-json-data-sources">Taking advantage of JSON
data sources</h2>
<p>Newt prototype works with a JSON source that can be accessed via URL
and HTTP methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE) using http
protocol. Many systems have JSON data API today (2023). This includes
existing Library, Archive and Museum applications like Invenio RDM and
ArchivesSpace as well as search engines like Solr and Elasticsearch.
This means Newt can be used to extend existing systems that provide a
localhost JSON data source.</p>
<p>In the future Newt may be extended to support a JSON data source
external to your machine (e.g. CrossRef, DataCite, ORCID). It would
require the Newt code base to be updated to support https protocol in
additional to the existing http protocol.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>My belief is that many web services used by Archives, Libraries and
Museums can benefit from a simplified and consistent back-end. If the
back-end is “easy” then the limited developer resources can be focused
on the front-end. <strong>An improved front-end offers opportunities to
provide a more humane experience for staff and patrons.</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve written many web applications over the years. Newt is focused on
providing very specific glue to other microservices which already
perform the core of an application (e.g. PostgREST presenting a data
management engine and Pandoc server presenting a template engine). Newt
takes a declarative model to configuration. You define things. From
those definitions it delegates processing to JSON data sources and
optionally to Pandoc server if JSON needs to be transformed into HTML.
It does this by limiting it’s responsibility to verifying routes
declared in the YAML file and validating paths and form data requests.
Newt only runs on localhost only. It is happy to run behind a more full
featured web service like Apache 2 or NginX.</p>
<h2 id="newt-stack-front-end-to-back-end">Newt stack, front-end to
back-end</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A front end web server (e.g. Apache 2, NginX) can provide access
control where appropriate (e.g. single sign-on via Shibboleth)</p></li>
<li><p>Newt provides static file services but more importantly serves as
a data router. It can validate and map a request to a JSON source, take
those results then send them through Pandoc for transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>JSON data source(s) provide the actual metadata management</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres+PostgREST is an example of a JSON source integrated with a
SQL server</li>
<li>Solr, Elasticsearch or Opensearch can also function as a JSON source
oriented towards search</li>
<li>ArchivesSpace, Invenio RDM are examples of systems that can function
as a JSON sources</li>
<li>CrossRef, DataCite, ORCID are examples of services that function as
JSON sources</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pandoc server provides a templating engine to transform data
sources</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All these can be treated as “off the shelf”. I.e. we’re not writing
them from scratch but we’re accessing them via configuration. Even using
PostgREST with Postgres the “source” boils down to SQL used to define
the data models hosted by the SQL service. Your application is
implemented using SQL and configured with YAML and Pandoc templates.</p>
<h2 id="getting-newt-pandoc-postgrest-and-postgres">Getting Newt,
Pandoc, PostgREST and Postgres</h2>
<p>Newt is an experimental prototype (June/July 20230). It is only
distributed in source code form. You need a working Go language
environment, git, make and Pandoc to compile Newt from source code. See
<a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL.md</a> for details.</p>
<p>Pandoc is available from <a href="https://pandoc.org"
class="uri">https://pandoc.org</a>, Postgres is available from <a
href="https://postgres.org" class="uri">https://postgres.org</a> and
PostgREST is available from <a href="https://postgrest.org"
class="uri">https://postgrest.org</a>. If you want to compile the latest
Pandoc or PostgREST (both are written in Haskell), I recommend using
GHCup <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/"
class="uri">https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/</a></p>
