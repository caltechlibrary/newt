<h1 id="newt">Newt</h1>
<p>Newt is an experimental <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a>
working with other “off the shelf” microservices. It is a proof of
concept of a “new take” on the old web stack. The “new stack” is built
on off the shelf microservices. The initial target was
Postgres+PostgREST and Pandoc server. In practice the Postgres+PostgREST
can be replaced (or operating along side) and JSON data source
(i.e. JSON API whos interface uses http).</p>
<h2 id="np3-the-newt-stack">NP^3, the newt stack</h2>
<ul>
<li>N is the Newt data router, form validator, static file
microservice</li>
<li>P^3 is
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> server</li>
<li><a href="https://postgres.org">Postgres</a> + <a
href="https://postgrest.org">PostgREST</a> JSON API</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="np3-plus">NP^3 plus</h2>
<p>The targetted microservices all run on localhost. Individually they
have very narrow focuses. In a production setting you would normally run
them behind a front-end web server like Apache 2 or NginX. The advantage
of this approach is that the front-end web service can provide things
like authentication or single sign-on integration. It also allows a NP^3
based application to sit along many other web applications on the same
virtual host.</p>
<h2 id="the-way-newt-works">The way Newt works</h2>
<p>Newt is configured with a YAML file. Currently the configuration file
uses three main attributes</p>
<dl>
<dt>htdocs</dt>
<dd>
The path to the htdoc directory holding any static assets (e.g. CSS,
JavaScript, HTML files, image assets)
</dd>
<dt>env</dt>
<dd>
A list of environment varaibles available to Newt’s routes
</dd>
<dt>routes</dt>
<dd>
An object describing the mapping of request information, how to map it
to a JSON data source and optional Pandoc server processing of the
result
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The routes attribute itself is a object with the following
attributes</p>
<dl>
<dt>var</dt>
<dd>
(optional) A list of variable names and types used in validating a
request path or web from submission
</dd>
<dt>req_path</dt>
<dd>
A expression describing a URL path recieved by Newt (typical made by a
web browser or proxy for the web browser)
</dd>
<dt>req_method</dt>
<dd>
An HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) related to the
req_path being handled
</dd>
<dt>api_url</dt>
<dd>
The URL expression used by Newt to contact the JSON data source for the
route described by req_path and req_method
</dd>
<dt>api_method</dt>
<dd>
The HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) of the JSON data
source associated api_url for the given route
</dd>
<dt>api_content_type</dt>
<dd>
The HTTP content type expression used when submitting the request to the
JSON data source
</dd>
<dt>pandoc_template</dt>
<dd>
(optional) The path to the pandoc template used to process the results
of the JSON data source request results
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additional attributes maybe added to the YAML file in the future.</p>
<h2 id="newt-data-flow">Newt data flow</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Web browser =&gt; Newt</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; JSON data source =&gt; Newt</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; Pandoc =&gt; Newt</li>
<li>Newt =&gt; Web browser</li>
</ol>
<p>The Pandoc processing is optional. In this way you could expose
selected elements of your JSON data source to the front-end web service
by mapping the access but skipping the Pandoc template used to transform
the data.</p>
<h3 id="handling-errors">Handling errors</h3>
<p>Newt vets the initial request before contacting the JSON data source.
If the request has a problem it will return an appropriate HTTP status
code and message. If the request to the JSON data source has a problem,
it will pass through the HTTP status code and message provided by the
JSON datasource. Likewise if Pandoc server has a problem Newt will
forward that HTTP status code and message.</p>
<h3 id="static-file-support">static file support</h3>
<p>Newt first checks if a request is matched in one of the route
definitions. If that fail then it’ll check against what is available in
the htdocs directory if defined in the YAML file. It will return a 404
if no match is found.</p>
<h3 id="np3-opportunities">NP^3 Opportunities</h3>
<p>The Newt stack aims to work with “off the shelf” web services. This
includes external web services like CrossRef, DataCite or ORCID. These
all provide JSON API that can be accessed over HTTP.</p>
<p>As Newt’s job is to route requests to a JSON data source and
(optionally) process the results with Pandoc server it is not limitted
to a specific application. A Newt “app” is simply a collection of
routes. They migth all be related but do not have to be.</p>
<h3 id="handling-secrets-scaling-and-limitations">Handling secrets,
scaling and limitations</h3>
<p>Newt’s YAML file does not explicitly contain any secrets. This was
intentional. You may need to pass sensitive data to your JSON data
source for access (e.g. credentials like a username and password). This
should be provided via the environment and the YAML file needs to
include these environment variable names in the “env” attribute. The
environment variables can be used to contact the JSON data source and
theoretically that data source code echo them to Pandoc or the
requesting browser. They is no easy way to prevent that so care should
be taken to make sure your JSON data source does not echo those values
or return so that Pandoc would process them in a template and return
back to the web browser.</p>
<p>While Newt was concieved to services small scale web applications in
Libraries, Archives and Museums it is capable of scaling big as long as
your JSON data source can scale big. Using the NP^3 stack elements Newt,
Pandoc and PostgREST can all be run easily behind load balancers and in
parallel across machines because they require no synchronizated shared
of data. Postgres itself can be configured in a HA cluster to support
high availability and high demand.</p>
<p>Presently Newt does not support file uploads. This may change in the
future.That limits Newt’s present application targets. If you needed
that support today then you’d need to configure your front-end web
server to proxy to a service that could provide file upload support.</p>
<p>Newt runs exclusively as a localhost service. In a production setting
you’d run Newt behind a traditional web server like Apache 2 or NginX.
The front-end web service can provide access control via basic auth or
single sign-on (e.g. Shibboleth). It plays nicely in a container
environment or running straight up as a system service.</p>
<h2 id="taking-advantage-json-sources">Taking advantage JSON
sources</h2>
<p>Newt works with a JSON source that can be accessed via URL and HTTP
methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE). Many systems have JSON
data API today (2023). This includes existing Library, Archive and
Museum applications like Invenio RDM and ArchivesSpace as well as search
engines like Solr and Elasticsearch. It also includes many library
services like CrossRef, DataCite and ORCID. These can be integrated via
Newt in a easily managed may.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>My belief is that many web services used by Archives, Libraries and
Museums can benefit from a simplified and consistent back-end. If the
back-end is “easy” then the limited developer resources can be focused
on the front-end. <strong>An improved front-end offers opportunities to
provide a more humane experience for staff and patrons.</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve written many web applications over the years. Newt is focused on
providing very specific glue to other microservices which already
perform the core of an application (e.g. PostgREST presenting a data
management engine and Pandoc server presenting a template engine). Newt
takes a declarative model to configuration. You define things. From
those definitions it delagates processing to JSON data sources and
optionally to Pandoc server if JSON needs to be transformed into HTML.
It does this by limitting it’s responsibility to verifying routes
declared in the YAML file and validating paths and form data requests.
Newt only runs on localhost so does not provide a means of virtual
hosting or other things associated with a front-end web service.</p>
<h2 id="np3-stack">NP^3 stack</h2>
<p>From front-end to back-end</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A front end web server (e.g. Apache 2, NginX) can provide access
control where appropriate (e.g. single sign-on via Shibboleth)</p></li>
<li><p>Newt provides static file services but more importantly serves as
a data router. It can validate and map a request to a JSON source, take
those results then send them through Pandoc for transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>JSON data source(s) provide the actual metadata management</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres+PostgREST is an example of a JSON source integrated with a
SQL server</li>
<li>Solr, Elasticsearch or Opensearch can also function as a JSON source
oriented towards search</li>
<li>ArchivesSpace, Invenio RDM are examples of systems that can function
as a JSON sources</li>
<li>CrossRef, DataCite, ORCID are examples of services that function as
JSON sources</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pandoc server provides a templating engine to transform data
sources</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All these can be treated as “off the shelf”. I.e. we’re not writing
them from skratch but we’re accessing them via configuration. Even using
PostgREST with Postgres the “source” boils down to SQL used to define
the data models hosted by the SQL service. Your application is
implemented using SQL and configured with YAML and Pandoc templates.</p>
<h2 id="getting-newt-pandoc-postgrest-and-postgres">Getting Newt,
Pandoc, PostgREST and Postgres</h2>
<p>Newt is an experimental prototype (June/July 20230). It is only
distributed in source code form. You need a working Go langauge
environment, git, make and Pandoc to compile Newt from source code. See
<a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL.md</a> for details.</p>
<p>Pandoc is available from <a href="https://pandoc.org"
class="uri">https://pandoc.org</a>, Postgres is available from <a
href="https://postgres.org" class="uri">https://postgres.org</a> and
PostgREST is available from <a href="https://postgrest.org"
class="uri">https://postgrest.org</a>. If you want to compile the latest
Pandoc or PostgREST (both are written in Haskell), I recommend using
GHCUp <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/"
class="uri">https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/</a></p>
