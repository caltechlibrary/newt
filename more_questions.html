<h1 id="questions">Questions?</h1>
<h2 id="where-is-my-development-time-going-to-be-spent">Where is my
development time going to be spent?</h2>
<p>The developer writes YAML to generate the back end data management
and templates to render web pages for your application. You can enhance
the generated code further if you want. I suspect that you’ll spend most
of your time improving the human experience of your application through
improving the HTML markup in the templates, writing some CSS and perhaps
enhancing behavior with the JavaScript run in the web browser. If you
need to enhance the back end you work in SQL. If you simply need to
improve the rendering of your database results then you are working with
Mustache templates.</p>
<h2
id="what-about-security-integration-with-single-sign-on-or-other-websites-or-services">What
about security, integration with single sign-on or other websites or
services?</h2>
<p>The <code>newtrouter</code> is a simple web service providing data
routing based on its YAML configuration. It’s a team player. In a
production setting it should be used behind a front end web server like
Apache 2 or NGINX. That latter can be configured to support single
sign-on systems like Shibboleth<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The front end web
service controls access and handles securing the connection with the web
browser. The front end web service proxies to the Newt router. Newt
router receives requests and runs the data pipelines on localhost. The
data pipelines can be composed of off the shelf software like
Postgres+PostgREST, Solr and template engine to turn your JSON into a
web page. Having a clear division of responsibilities helps in securing
your web application. Since Newt router only knows how to talk to
services on localhost you can keep it contained and prevent it from
being used for nefarious actions off system. Like Newt router Newt
Mustache is constrained to localhost for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Limiting Newt web service applications to localhost keeps them
simple. Doing the minimum limits the attack surface for those who want
to do mischief. Neither <code>newtrouter</code> or
<code>newtmustache</code> write to disk or require secrets. They only
communicate via localhost using HTTP protocol.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-scaling">What about “scaling”?</h2>
<p><code>newtrouter</code> is just a router. Aside from reading
configuration at start up it doesn’t maintain state.
<code>newtmustache</code> functions the same way, read in the
configuration and just run. By assigning different ports you can also
run many instances of them. This makes it possible to run them in
parallel, behind load balancer or even through proxying spread them
across many machines. The instances don’t share data or coordinate. They
start up wait for a request and providing an answer.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean? In principle a Newt based applications
can scale big as the slowest element of your pipeline service.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-anatomy-of-a-newt-based-web-application">What is the
anatomy of a Newt based web application?</h2>
<p>Newt application development is friendly to version control systems
(e.g. Git). It consists of a Newt configuration file, along with
generated SQL files, HTML templates and any static web assets you’ve
added. A typical disk layout of a Newt project could look like this-</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code> project folder
<ul>
<li><code>app.yaml</code> would holds the configuration of our Newt
tools</li>
<li><code>postgrest.conf</code>, the configuration file for
PostgREST</li>
<li><code>htdocs</code> this directory holds your static content needed
by your web application</li>
<li><code>app_setup.sql</code> and <code>*_models.sql</code> these are
the SQL files used by your application to define your models and
behaviors in Postgres</li>
<li><code>*.tmpl</code> your Mustache templates for turning JSON into
HTML</li>
<li><code>CITATION.cff</code> or <code>codemeta.json</code> for project
metadata</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
