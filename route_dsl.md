# A RouteDSL, a domain specific language describing routing

How do you describe mapping of one path to another? Many web frameworks implement the concept of a "route" which is similar to a file path but may include a placeholder notation for values bound to variable names. The variable names are then available to route handler functions.

Newt's route handler capability is fixed. It can perform a mapping from a request to data API, and optional run the results through Pandoc. A route in Newt is defined using variables including a type. A given type can be validated before transforming the request to a data API call or Pandoc. This provides a level of assurance that the URL requested is what is expected by the back-end data source like PostgREST, Solr or Elasticsearch.

## Why create yet another DSL?

I surveyed the route descriptions available in several Python and JavaScript frameworks. There was no consensus. None provided a mechanism to validate the variables captured int he in-bound request. Since Newt's scope is extremely limited this lead me to think about a simple, light weight markup that would be intuitive for web developers. Since Newt is intended to work with Pandoc templates I chose a similar delimiter for template variables.  What was missing a type annotation for in-bound requests.  Injecting a type annotation for the request URL pattern mean that the URL composed or the JSON data API request or Pandoc server request could just be simple handlebars template strings. This means the is only one added concept for a well known template notation.

## Blogging URLs, a use case

RouteDSL should be able to handle simple mappings such as those seen in blogs. Blog paths are often predictable.  A home page is at `/`, a feed of items might be at `/feed/` and individual blog posts might be found in a path formed by embedding four digit year, two digit month, two digit day and a title slug. Let's first look at how that would be described as a Mustache template -- `/blog/${year}/${month}/${day}/${title-slug}`.  This is pretty easy to read. 

How do we know when a path value matches a route?  For a literal path you can simply perform a string comparison but for a path with embedded variables you need to vet the variables to make sure they make sense. A type check needs to be done. In our simple Mustache version though there is no type information. The place holder `${year}` might hold an integer or maybe something completely unrelated.  What if we added an annotation about the variables type? A "year" certainly can be validate. Years are normally four digit numbers.  Likewise month and day could have a simple validation based on being an integer with two digits allowing for leading zeros. These are common enough date formats that many languages provide via standard libraries. Creating types for these types becomes a matter of wrapping an implementations existing type system.

~~~
/blog/${year Year}/${month Month}/${day Day}/${title-slug String}
~~~

Now we know the type and validation method to apply to the embedded variable. Let's explore some values and see if they can be validated.

path value                      year month day title-slug    is it valid?
------------------------------  ---- ----- --- ------------- -----------------
/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post  2023 02    28  my-daily-post yes
/blog/2023/02/31/my-daily-post  2023 02    31  my-daily-post no, invalid day
/blog/2023/28/02/my-daily-post  2023 28    01  my-daily-post no, invalid month

Knowing the type lets the router know that path is not valid and reject it if it is not without contacting other services. 

While the RouteDSL specification is not intended to describe a canonical set of types an implementation of a RouteDSL certain would.  It should be easy to implement the type system with one or two functions per type.  I suspect as RouteDSL are implemented a canonical core set of type will emerge.

In my prototype implementation of RouteDSL I plan to implement the following types and validating primitive data types -- "Integer", "String", "Real", "Boolean", "Date", "Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Minute", "Second".  The Python project [IdUtils](https://idutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) also suggests a common set of identifiers used in the Library, Archive and Museum communities.  A subset of these will be implemented for the prototype of RouteDSL (e.g. "ORCID", "DOI", "ROR").

Here's an example of what our RouteDSL would enable. I think of these as a path expression --

~~~
`/blog/${year Year}/${month Month}/${day Day}/${title-slug}`
~~~

A transformed version of the input route could then be described simply as a handlebar template.

~~~
http://localhost:3000/blog?year=${year}&month=${month}&day=${day}&title_slug=${title-slug}
~~~

If the request value matches both form and type of embedded variables then you have enough information to call a microservice like PostgREST, Solr or Opensearch.

## Use case, representing filenames and extensions in a path

What if your request URL uses file extensions to indicate the choice of template to use when rendering with Pandoc?  Here's three examples where the content might be the same but the format changes (e.g. HTML, Markdown and plain text).

~~~
/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post.html
/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post.md
/blog/2023/02/28/my-daily-post.txt
~~~

In our prior example each embedded variable was contained in one element of the path.  A filename can be thought of as one element or as a "basename" and "extension". How can we allow for that use case?  In the use case about the "title-slug" corresponds to the "basename" but the file extension indicates which template to send to Pandoc server.

Here's how you might represent that in RouteDSL.

~~~
`/blog/{year Year}/{month Month}/{day Day}/{title-slug basename}{ext extname}`
~~~

Many implementation languages support parsing path into directory components as well as filename and extension. RouteDSL should be able to leverage this. This suggests an algorithmic behavior in our RouteDSL evaluation.

First RouteDSL should split the path into it's component, then it should determine if the component is a literal string or a variable definition. For each component the variable definition needs to conform to it's type. The trailing element in a URL path can also have the types of "basename" (excluding the file extension), extname (for the file extension value). In the case where you want to treat both the basename and extension as a single unit we have the String type shown previously.


## Algorithm for evaluating a path value against a RouteDSL expression

- A RouteDSL expression decode into it's path components parts
    - zero or more directory names
        - directory name can be a literal
        - directory name can be a variable definition
    - zero or one filename
        - a filename can be a literal
        - a filename can be a variable expression
- A path value is split into it's components
    - zero or more directory names
    - zero or one filename and extension
- Compare each path value element against each RouteDSL expression elements
    - if both are literals
        - stop processing if they do not match, return false
    - if RouteDSL component is a variable, valid the path value component against variable type
        - stop of it does not validate, return false
- If comparison completes without return false we have a match

## Variable definitions

In the use cases we've suggested how a variable in a RouteDSL expression can include a variable name as well as a type annotation to use to validate the value bound to the variable name. Let's specify this in more detail.

- variable definition start with two opening curly brace and conclude with a closing curly brace (i.e. basic Mustache template style notation)
- following the opening curly braces is a variable name which is formed from a letter and one or more alphanumeric characters or an underscores or dashes (i.e. what would be a valid attribute name in a JSON object). E.g.  - `a`, `a1`, `a_long_variable_name`, `title-slug` are valid variable names
    - `""`, `1a`, `+1`, `{}`, `()`, `$foo` are not valid variable names
- a variable name is followed by a space and type expression
- a type expression starts with a letter and can be followed by one or more characters excluding a closing curly brace

Here's some example variable definitions.

~~~
{year Year}
{month Month}
{day Day}
{orcid Regexp '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'}
~~~

These would result in the following type maps expressed in JSON

~~~
{
    "year": "Year",
    "month": "Month",
    "day": "Day",
    "orcid": "Regexp '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]'"
}
~~~

When a request URL is evaluated against the route template's type it will return a simple object with variable names mapped to string versions of the values. This will allow transforming both data API URLs and calls to Pandoc service via a simple Mustache like template implementation.

The RouteDSL does not define the supported types only that the information can be extracted from a RouteDSL expression as a map between variable names and a type description. It is up to the specific RouteDSL implementation to define how the type information is interpreted.

## Variable decoding

If a path value matches a RouteDSL expression then when the variables and values can be extracted as a map of variable names and values. The only constraint is that the map be expressible as a valid JSON object. E.g.

Given the RouteDSL expression

~~~
/people/{orcid ORCID}
~~~

and the path value

~~~
/people/0000-0003-0900-6903
~~~

The resulting map would look like this JSON

~~~
{
    "orcid": "0000-0003-0900-6903"
}
~~~

Given the RouteDSL expression

~~~
/blog/{year Year}/{month Month}/{day Day}/{title-slug basename}{ext extname}
~~~

And the path value

~~~
/blog/2022/11/07/compiling-pandoc-from-source.html
~~~

A RouteDSL implementation should return a map, dictionary or associative array with the values
converted to the type suggested in the variable's type definition. The constraint is that the map can be expressed as a JSON object. E.g.

~~~
{
    "year": 2022,
    "month": 11,
    "day": 7,
    "title-slug": "compiling-pandoc-from-source",
    "ext": ".html"
}
~~~

In this case our types "Month", "Day", "Year" converted the values to JSON numbers and the rest were left as JSON strings.
