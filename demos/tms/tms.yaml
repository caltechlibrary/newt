# This is the Newt Project description for the Thesis Management System.
# It will run in a single table modeling the current state of the Thesis workflow.
#
# Postgres PL/Python will be used to trigger emails when status change
# An external process will query the model table and then make adjustments in the
# RDM review queie or published record, (assuming RDM v12 or later).
