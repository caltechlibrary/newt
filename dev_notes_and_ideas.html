<h1 id="development-notes-and-ideas">Development Notes and Ideas</h1>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="release-action">release action</h3>
<p>At somepoint in development your Newt app you will want to prepare it
for deployment. This could be done with a “release” action where the
Bash/Powershell scripts get generated for deployment as well as
additional service files such as those needed for systemd, launchd or
whatever Windows uses to run services.</p>
<h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>
<p>One idea was to push validation back into Postgres+PostsgRESTS, this
is tricky as debugging SQL takes a long time.</p>
<p>Idea two was to generate a validation service for the models
associated with a new project. The question is what langauge? TypeScript
seems reasonable as the validation code could be shared browser side via
TypeScript transpilation to JavaScript. Deno seems the right platform
for this.</p>
<p>An older idea I considered was to generate Lua based functions that
run in the router. A route could be flagged to use the validation for a
specific model so input would be validated before entering the pipeline.
This has the advantage that Lua is designed to be embedded and I would
not require Deno to be available. This in effect would be a pseudo
service in the data pipeline. Downside could be performance of the Newt
data router depending on implementation details. Another downside is
that generating browser side validation, beyond that which HTML 5
provides, is not achieved.</p>
<h3 id="pseudo-services">Pseudo services</h3>
<p>There are two use cases where having a pseudo service available
before or after the pipeline makes sense. Validation before starting the
data pipeline makes sense. Another case is when creating, updating or
deleting objects. The POST, PUT and DELETE are easily handled by the
pipeline but right now I wind up with two templates for each action
because I need to handle the care of deliverying the web form and of
course handling the response. It would be nice to simply redirect a
successful create or update to the read end point. In the case of create
before record creation the identifier isn’t known but when the process
completes it could be used to redirect the browser to the read page for
the newly created object. Update also could use the same mechanism for
redirection even though the identifier is available via the URL path
segment. Finally delete on success could redirect to either the read
page with object status (e.g. not found or deleted), the list of objects
page or an error page that idendicates the object is no longer
available.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-multiple-back-ends">Supporting multiple “back
ends”</h2>
<p>The initial versions of Newt prototypes assume the back end is
Postgres+PostgREST. While robust Postgres and PostgREST are non-trivial
applications which places a burden on the novice end user using Newt to
generate their application. Newt should support alternatives. What might
those be?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dataset+datasetd provides a nice object collection platform and that
itself supports Postgres and SQLite3. This platform doens’t currently
support object validation but using the YAML notation from Newt it would
be easy to implement. This would encourage a short pipeline with allot
of flexibility to add queries and such that datasetd supports.</li>
<li>Deno+TypeScript+SQLite3 would be a nice back end. The TypeScript API
service could be generated using a very similar API to Dataset+datasetd.
This would be easy to evolve over time when the project owner outgrew
Newt. Deno+TypeScript can be compiled down to standalone binaries
including limited cross compilation. This would open the door to
creating a non-Newt hosted application.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I provide back end choices I should default to one to keep the
“model”, “generate”, “run” sequence simple but allow the other back ends
to be configured if needed.</p>
<h2 id="code-organization">Code organization</h2>
<p>The current code organization needs to be refactor to allow for
better integration of future features. One challenging point is managing
the routes and template maps based on actions. If the back end changes
from Postgres+PostgREST to something else the routes and their pipelines
will likely change, additionally it may impact the templates or their
mapping. Right now generating the YAML for routes and template maps is
conflated. It would be better to organize that by action which then
could use the AST applications proprerty to call the right generation
code.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>Should routes and template maps be generated at model change or at
the generation stage?</p>
