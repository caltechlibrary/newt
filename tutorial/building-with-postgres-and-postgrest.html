<h1 id="building-with-postgresql-and-postgrest">Building with PostgreSQL
and PostgREST</h1>
<p>I would like to suggest a simplification in building web
applications. Can you build a complete web application using only SQL,
HTML and browser side JavaScript? Can you do it with off the shelf
services like Postgres and PostgREST? Our application uses a
microservice model. Data is modeled and managed via a Postgres 15
database. The database content is managed through a JSON data API
provided by PostgREST 11. Assuming you have a static file server handy
you can do the page assembly browser side. In the scenario the
index.html and sightings.js files access the JSON data API microservice
providing a human friendly view of our modeled data.</p>
<p>How does this approach simplify creating and managing web
applications?</p>
<p>The back-end becomes largely declarative broken down into three
simple tasks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>define your data schema in SQL</li>
<li>Populate your database tables with some working content</li>
<li>Setup PostgREST access to manage the data base contents</li>
</ol>
<p>While two different programs (i.e. Postgres and PostgREST) they
present a unified view of your data via a predictable JSON API. Running
a web server in front of Postgres+PostgREST as a proxy will let you
build the rest of your application in the front-end using HTML and
JavaScript running in the web browser. The back-end can be debugged by
either interacting directly with Postgres or by using curl to test
PostgREST responses.</p>
<h1 id="a-bit-more-about-postgrest">A bit more about PostgREST</h1>
<p>PostgREST provides a generic middle ware that transforms a Postgres
database into a RESTful JSON data API that can be OpenAPI compliant if
desired. PostgREST knows the schema for the database because it knows
how Postgres works. It provides simplified routes (URL paths) for
interacting with a database, queries, views and stored procedures via
standard HTTP methods (e.g. GET, POST). If these are proxied via your
web server then you can use them to allow the front-end running in the
web browser to manage display. The back-end code you right is only what
you need to model the data in Postgres and facilitated access via
PostgREST. You make more elaborate end points available in PostgREST via
stored functions and views but for many simple applications what is
provided out of the box by PostgREST may be enough.</p>
<h1
id="how-much-sql-do-i-need-to-know-to-use-postgres-with-postgrest">How
much SQL do I need to know to use Postgres with PostgREST?</h1>
<p>The bare minimum would be to now how to create a database, create a
table and the basic SELECT statement. In most read only style
applications that’s all you really need to use. Have an understanding of
Postgres SCHEMA[2] will make understanding how PostgREST works
easier.</p>
<p>A more rounded minimum SQL knowledge would include being familiar
with DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. It is really helpful
to have a basic understanding of VIEWS[3]. An understanding of stored
procedures and functions[4] allows you to take full advantage of
PostgREST’s capabilities.</p>

application responsibilities</h2>
<p>The architecture is traditional. It is normally called a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservice</a>
architecture. The novel feature presented here is that the services are
completely off the shelf. The only back-end programming to be done is
setting up the Postgres database using SQL. The rest is delegated to the
web browser using the traditional troika of HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Two microservices provide data manage and transformation</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL, data modeling, data and role management</li>
<li>PostgREST, turning what we have in Postgres into a JSON data
API</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The front end web server and web browser provides our human facing
interface through static HTML and JavaScript</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stepping-through-birds-2-demo">Stepping through Birds 2
Demo</h2>
<p>The birds two demo consists of the following files.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="birds2/README.html">README.md</a></li>
<li><a href="birds2/birds.csv">birds.csv</a></li>
<li><a href="birds2/htdocs">htdocs</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="birds2/htdocs/index.html">index.html</a></li>
<li><a href="birds2/htdocs/sightings.js">sightings.js</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="birds2/postgrest.conf">postgrest.conf</a></li>
<li><a href="birds2/setup.sql">setup.sql</a> ~~~</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic development cycle can be broken down into the following
steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a database ans setup the Postgres SCHEMA (namespace) which
will be used to allow PostgREST to access our data (SQL)</li>
<li>Creating our database model(s) (SQL)</li>
<li>Loading data from a CSV file (also done via SQL)</li>
<li>Startup PostgREST and confirm we can access the content</li>
<li>Create and debug our index.html/sightings.js files in the web
browser</li>
</ol>
<p>As you evolve the application you’ll likely repeat steps two through
four.</p>
<h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>PostgreSQL 15 and PostgREST 11 need to be setup and configured to
work together</li>
<li>You need a simple web server
(e.g. <code>python3 -m http.server</code>) for serving static
content</li>
<li>You need a web browser (e.g. Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge)</li>
<li>You need your favorite text editor (e.g. micro, vim, Emacs, VSCode,
Zed)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Birds 2 demo is a proof of concept showing much simplified back-end
development process. Namely define your schema and let
Postgres/PostgREST do the rest. It does come at the expense of making
the front-end work running the web browser more complicated. It remains
to be seen if this is worth the trade off.</p>
