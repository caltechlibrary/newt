<h1 id="a-short-history-of-web-development-and-databases">A short
history of web development and databases</h1>
<p>Databases have been used to generate web pages since the early web.
Databases are well suited to managing data. When the web became dynamic,
databases continued to be use for data persistence. By 1993 the web as
an application platform was born<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and with it a good
platform for providing useful organizational and institutional
software.</p>
<p>By the mid 1990s the Open Source databases like MySQL and Postgres
were popular choices for building web applications. It is important to
note neither MySQL or Postgres spoke HTTP<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. To
solve this problem many people wrote software in languages like Perl,
PHP and Python that ran inside the popular Apache web server. It was a
pain to setup but once setup relatively easy to build things that relied
on databases. This led the web to explode with bespoke systems. By the
late 1990s and early 2000s the practice of “mashing up” sites
(i.e. content reuse) was the rage. Bespoke systems took advantage of
content reuse too. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes">Yahoo Pipes</a> was a
very interesting expression of the “mashup culture”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
Yahoo Pipes inspired Newt’s data pipelines. Eventual the bespoke systems
gave way to common use cases<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. A good example of a
common use case is Apache’s <a href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a>
search engine. Another example is how bespoke content management systems
gave way to <a href="https://plone.org">Plone</a>, <a
href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a> and <a
href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Web applications proceeded to eat all the venerable
green screen systems they could find. Today’s web is mired in
surveillance tech and complex solutions. It has drifted far from Sir.
Tim’s vision of sharing science documents. We need to refocus on the
“good ideas” and jettison the complexity that came with the surveillance
economy. Newt can be part of that solution. Develop your Newt
application with consideration for others.<a href="#fnref1"

<li id="fn2"><p>HTTP being the protocol the communicates with.
Essentially at the time RDBMS spoke a dialect of SQL as the unifying
language. The web of the time understood HTML and to a certain degree
XML. By 2000 people were looking for something simpler than XML to move
structured data about. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> quickly became the
answer.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The basic concept was to make it easy to work with “data
feeds” and combined them into a useful human friendly web pages. It even
included a visual programming language to make it friendly to the
non-programmer crowd.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>If a use case is solved reliably enough it becomes “off
the shelf” software.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
