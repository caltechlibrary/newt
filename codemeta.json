  "description": "Newt is an experimental rapid application development. It is a toolbox for creating metadata curation applications. Newt applications implement a service orient architecture to minimize the code you have to write and maintain. The Newt approach emphasizes off the shelf components.  Newt comes with a data router, a stateless template engine and a developer tool. The developer tool includes data modeler, code generator and app runner. Data models are described in YAML similar to a YAML description of a web form. The code generator targets SQL and conf files for running Postgres plus PostgREST. It can generate handlebar templates from your modeled data. If manages the data routes and template mapping. It can generate a TypeScript validation service based on your data models. Newt composes your metadata curation application from these services.",

  "releaseNotes": "This release implements the Newt third prototype. It uses a new simpler YAML syntax. It comes with four programs, newtrouter, newtmustache, newtgenerator and a developer tool called newt.",
