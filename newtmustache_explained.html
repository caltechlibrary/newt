<p>The Newt Mustache template engine came about due to three
concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>People don’t think about Pandoc as a web service</li>
<li>Some people don’t like Pandoc templates or are unfamiliar with
Pandoc</li>
<li>Pandoc’s web server doesn’t handle Pandoc’s partial template
support</li>
</ul>
<p>When building a web application using a template system it is very
useful to minimize the number of templates you need to know and work
with. One way this is done is to build smaller partial templates that
handle specific content elements or types. E.g. a bibliographic citation
used on a book receive site</p>
<p>When you run Pandoc from the command line this is readily supported.
Unfortunately Pandoc web service doesn’t support this as of version 3.1.
The web service only knows about the full template you provide as part
of the JSON blob. Another problem with the web service is that you must
provide both the template and JSON DATA for each request you make to the
web service. Internally Pandoc web service unpacks the template, parses
it then applies the data object you provided. How might we simplify the
process?</p>
<p>Ideally a simple template engine is stateless once it has started up.
This doesn’t mean it can’t take advantage of configuration when starting
up. If a simple template engine knew that templates were found in a
directory it could read all the templates in the directory at start up.
It could resolve partial template issues and be ready for any request.
If we leverage the URL to indicate the template desired to be used then
the JSON received as the POST data doesn’t need to include a wrapping
object like Pandoc web server does.</p>
<p>I thought about writing a pre-processor for Pandoc web server but
then decided I don’t have time. I checked the current status of
languages supporting Mustache templates. The list had grown and also
includes a nice Go package for working with Mustache templates. That was
the seed for Newt’s own template engine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mustache is a widely support template language with support include
Go, Python, and JavaScript (languages used regularly at Caltech
Library)</li>
<li>Since a Go package provides Mustache template I only need to write a
light weight web service to wrap it</li>
<li>Since I am writing the service I can keep the requires to a minimum,
i.e. port and template directory</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="newtmustache-startup-sequence"><code>newtmustache</code> startup
sequence</h2>
<ul>
<li>read in the templates (e.g. read the contents of
<code>templates</code> directory or the location specified by the
command line option`</li>
<li>parse the read templates, log errors and skip templates which do not
parse succesfully</li>
<li>create a URL path handler for each template found in the
directory</li>
<li>start up the web service listen on the default port or one supplied
on the command line</li>
</ul>
