<h1 id="newt-mustache-explained">Newt Mustache explained</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Newt Mustache is a simple, light weight template engine supporting
the use of Mustache templates. If you send a JSON object to a configured
Newt Mustache template engine it can run that object through Mustache
and hand back a result. This usually means taking a JSON object
(e.g. JSON object delivered via PostgREST) and turning that object into
web page. That’s the type of templates you get from using Newt
Generator. Newt Mustache itself just cares about the JSON object it
recieves and applying the template configured for the request. Normally
the JSON object is sent to Newt Mustache as a HTTP POST action.</p>
<h2 id="testing-your-templates-with-newt-mustache">Testing your
templates with Newt Mustache</h2>
<p>Assuming you have Newt Mustache configuration in your “app.yaml” file
(i.e. there is a templates property completed there) and it points to
valid Mustache templates then Newt Mustache is ready to test. I usually
use <a href="https://curl.se">curl</a> to do my initial testing. In the
example I’m assuming you have a JSON file named “person.json” that
contains JSON markup that fits the templated called “people_read.tmpl”
which is going to be accessible with the URL
<code>http://localhost:8040/people_read.tmpl</code>. I first start Newt
Mustahe as a back ground process then use curl to check the template
result.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>newtmustache app.yaml &amp;
curl --data &#39;@person.json&#39; http://localhost:8040/people_read.tmpl</code></pre>
<p>I should now see HTML markup with the “person.json” content rendered
into the template. That’s all that Newt Mustache does. It reads in a
bunch of templates and requests paths at start, then renders them based
on the JSON objects you send them.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that changes you make in your templates
will NOT show up in the service until you restart Newt Mustache. This is
similar to the constraints regarding Newt Router and PostgREST.</p>
<h3 id="why-newt-mustache">Why Newt Mustache?</h3>
<p>The Newt Mustache template engine came about due to three concerns I
encountered with Pandoc web server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pandoc server usage is hard to debug</li>
<li>Many people don’t know or like Pandoc’s template language</li>
<li>Pandoc server does NOT support partial templates</li>
</ul>
<p>When building a web application using a template system it is very
useful to minimize the number of templates you need to know and work
with. One way this is done is to build smaller partial templates that
handle specific content elements or types. E.g. a bibliographic citation
used on a book review website.</p>
<p>When you run Pandoc from the command line this is readily supported.
Unfortunately Pandoc 3.1 server doesn’t support this. The server only
knows about the full template you provide as part of the JSON POST.
Mistakenly misconfigure the JSON you post to Pandoc and it will happly
give you nothing back. Not an error message, not a peep. Technically
it’s giving back what you requested but it’s a pain to fiddle with JSON
to get enough of a response to diagnose the problem. That was a show
stopper for Newt’s second prototype. Time to switch horses. Pandoc
server inspired Newt’s Mustache template service. Newt’s template
service is configured from YAML file. Settings are clearer. You can also
turn on debugging for a specific template you have concerns about. Like
Pandoc server Newt’ Mustache template engine is stateless. You can run
as many as you like as long as you have an available port.</p>
<p>Newt Mustache designd for use in Newt’s data pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="why-mustache-templates">Why Mustache templates?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mustache is a widely support template language with support include
Python, JavaScript, and Go (languages used regularly at Caltech
Library)</li>
<li>Since a Go package provides Mustache template I only need to write a
light weight web service to wrap it</li>
<li>Since I am writing the service I can keep the requires to a minimum,
i.e. <a href="newtmustache.1.html#newt_config_file">Use Newt’s YAML file
syntax</a>.</li>
</ul>
