newtpg
.SH SYNOPSIS
newtpg [CONFIG_FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]newtpg\f[R] is a command line tool for generate SQL suitable to
bootstrap a microservice implemented with PostgREST and Postgres.
It uses the same YAML file as the Newt web service using the namespace
and models attributes to render table structure, views and funcitons to
support basic CRUD and list operations in SQL.
.PP
\f[B]newtpg\f[R]\[cq]s configuration uses a declaritive model expressed
in YAML.
It can also allow environment variables read at start up to be part of
the data for mapping JSON data source requests.
This is particularly helpful for supplying access credentials.
You do not express secrets in the \f[B]newtpg\f[R] YAML configuration
file.
This follows the best practice used when working with container services
and Lambda like systems.

.PP
Newt has some experimental options to render Postgres dialect of SQL
from a YAML file containing models.
These options will render SQL suitable to bootstrap a
Newt+Pandoc+Postgres+PostgREST based project.
.TP
\-setup
This renders a SQL document suitable for bootstraping Postgres+PostgREST
access
.TP
\-models
This renders a SQL file to bootstrap modeling data with
Postgres+PostgREST
.TP
\-models\-test
This renders a SQL file to bootstrap writing SQL tests for
Postgres+PostgREST
.SH CONFIGURATION
\f[B]newtpg\f[R] looks for two attributes in the Newt YAML file.
.TP
namespace
This indicates the Postgres schema associated with your application
.TP
models
This is a list of models that map to tables in your Postgres
schema/database.
.PP
The \f[B]models\f[R] attribute holds a list of models expressed in
Newt\[cq]s data model DSL.
Models are optional but can be used to by Newt to generate bootstrap SQL
code for use with PostgREST+Postgres.
This is very experimental (2024) and likely to change as usage of Newt
increases.
Each model has a \f[CR]model\f[R] attribute holding the models name
(conforming to a variable name found in langauges like JavaScript,
Python, or Lua).
Each model also contains a \f[CR]var\f[R] attribute which is a list of
key/value pairs.
The key/value pairs are made from a variable name (key) and type
definition (value).
The type definitions are mapped to suitable Postgres SQL schema when
generating table definitions.
Example models used for groups and people metadata.
The asterix at the end of a type string indicates this is to be used as
a key when looking up the object.

.EE
.SH Defining variables
Each model can have its own associated set of variables.
Variables are \[lq]typed\[rq].
The code for type definitions includes validation.
When a variable is detected in a request path or form data it is vetted
using it\[cq]s associated type.
Only if the variables past validation are they allowed to be used to
assemble a request to a JSON data source.
.PP
Variables are defined in the YAML \[lq]var\[rq] attribute.
Here\[cq]s an example \[lq]var\[rq] definition defining three form
variables for a route.
The variable names are \[lq]bird\[rq], \[lq]place\[rq] and
\[lq]sighted\[rq] with the types \[lq]String\[rq], \[lq]String\[rq] and
\[lq]Date\[rq].
The \[lq]bird\[rq] variable is also a \[lq]key\[rq] for the table so has
its type end in an asterix.

.EE
.SH Variable types
.TP
String
Any sequence of characters.
If the variabe is embedded in a path then \[lq]/\[rq] will be used to
delimited path parts and would not be passed into the variables value.
.TP
Date
(default) A year, month, day string like 2006\-01\-02
.TP
Date 2006
A four digit year (e.g.\ 2023)
.TP
Date 01
A two digit month (e.g.\ \[lq]01\[rq] for January, \[lq]10\[rq] for
October)
.TP
Date 02
A two digit day (e.g.\ \[lq]01\[rq] for the first, \[lq]11\[rq] for the
eleventh)
.TP
Basename
A file\[cq]s basename (filename without an extension)
.TP
Extname
A file\[cq]s extension (e.g.\ \[lq].html\[rq], \[lq].txt\[rq],
\[lq].rss\[rq], \[lq].js\[rq])

NOTE: The current names associated with types will likely change as the
prototype \f[B]newtpg\f[R] evolves.
It is planned for them to be stable if and when we get to a v1 release
(e.g.\ when we\[cq]re out of the prototype phase).
