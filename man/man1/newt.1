.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
newt [CONFIG_FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[I]newt\f[R] is a microservice designed to work along side Postgres,
PostgREST, and Pandoc server.
It provides URL routing and data flow between the microserves based on a
simple configuration table holding routing information.
It is part of the Newt Project which is exploring building web services,
applications and sites using SQL for data modeling and define back-end
service behaviors along with Pandoc templates used to generate HTML
consumed by the web browser.
newt supports data hosted in Postgres databases via PostgREST JSON API
as well as static files contained in an \[lq]htdocs\[rq] directory
(e.g.\ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets).
.PP
This goel of Newt project is to be able to assemble an entire backend
from off the self services only requiring data modeling and route
definitions using SQL and a Postgres database.
Reducing the back-end to SQL may simplify application management (it
reduces it to a database administrator activity) and free up developer
time to focus more on front end development and human interaction.
It is also hoped that focusing the back-end on a declaritive model will
allow for a more consistent and reliable back-end.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
newt can be configured through the environment or through a PostgREST is
configuration file.
It adds only an optional uri for the Pandoc server (if used) when it
runs on a non-standard port.
