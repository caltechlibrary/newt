# To run this test, first run this file, you should see the projects docs
# and get a 502 Bad Gateway when you try to go to /birds1/.
# 
# Start up a static web service for demo/birds1/htdocs running on port 8000
# e.g. `ws demos/birds1/htdocs` should do it. Test the link again and you should
# see a table of bird sighting info. This is is working then the reouter and mustache
# services are up and running on their ports correctly.
